Using the non-linear specification with splines, we find that for the pooled sample employment chances
are mainly reduced for those reporting a diagnosis more than eleven years
ago, with each additional year reducing employment chances by about
two percentage points (Table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-duration-splines-1}).
When stratified into males and females, the
negative association persists for males and females albeit much weaker for the latter. Interestingly, using splines
we find a relatively strong reduction of wages 4-11 years after diagnosis
for women. We also find some significant associations for those with more than 19 years of diabetes, however, these estimates are likely spurious due to the considerably reduced number of observations particularly for wages and working hours.

\end{table}

Overall, the duration results are somewhat different to those found by \citet{Minor2013} for males and females in the USA, who does not find evidence for a linear relationship of diabetes duration with employment chances. Our results from the non-linear analysis are not directly comparable as \citet{Minor2013} uses dummy variables to identify different diabetes durations, nonetheless, they are similar in that he does not find an immediate effect of a diabetes diagnosis on employment chances. However, the effects still appear at an earlier point than in our analysis and are in general much larger. However, apart from not using splines he does not use individual fixed effects so that the results might still be biased leading to the larger effect sizes.
 
As a robustness check and due to the reduced number of observations for 20 or more years with diabetes we estimated the linear model again excluding those above 19 years of diabetes to investigate if the effects were driven by these rare observations. These results are available on request and indicate marginally smaller effect sizes, but do not change the qualitative interpretation of the effects.
