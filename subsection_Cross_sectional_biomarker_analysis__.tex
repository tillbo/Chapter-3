\subsection{Cross-sectional biomarker analysis}

The results presented in the previous section give us important information
on the association of self-reported diabetes with labour market outcomes
in Mexico. 

While panel data methods have obvious advantages over a cross sectional analysis,
it seems worthwhile to also use the
biomarker data collected in the third wave of the \ac{MxFLS}, even
if it only allows for a cross-sectional analysis. The biomarker data
provide us with the possibility to identify respondents with \ac{HbA1c} levels indicating diabetes
that have not yet been diagnosed. As mentioned before, biomarker
data are only provided for a subsample of the survey including everybody
age 45 and older and a random selection of participants before the
age of 45 \citep{Crimmins2015}. In this sub-sample 694 (10 percent)
self-report diabetes and 1248 (18 percent) have undiagnosed diabetes,
i.e. an \ac{HbA1c} over 6.4 percent.
