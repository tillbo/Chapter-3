\subsection{Cross-sectional biomarker analysis}

The results presented in the previous section did provide important
information on the association between self-reported diabetes and
with labour market outcomes in Mexico.

While panel data methods have obvious advantages over a cross sectional
analysis (presented in this section), there are additional insights
to be gained from making use of the biomarker data collected in the
third wave of the \ac{MxFLS}, even if it only allows for a cross-sectional
analysis. The biomarker data allows us to identify respondents with
\ac{HbA1c} levels, thereby identifying diabetes cases that have
not yet been 'officially' diagnosed. As mentioned before, biomarker
data are only available for a subsample of the survey, including everybody
aged 45+ as well as a random selection of participants below age 45
\citep{Crimmins2015}. In this sub-sample 694 (10 percent) self-report
diabetes and 1,248 (18 percent) have undiagnosed diabetes, i.e. as
measured by an \ac{HbA1c} above 6.4 percent.
