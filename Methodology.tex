\subsection{\noindent \label{sec:Data}The data}
The dataset used for the empirical analysis is the \acf{MxFLS}, a nationally representative longitudinal household survey with three waves conducted in 2002, 2005--2006 and 2009--2011, respectively.
Interviews were conducted with all household members aged 15 and above
and information on a wide range of social, demographic, economic characteristics
and health behaviours of the individuals and their families was collected
\citep{Rubalcava2013}. Apart from self-reported diabetes information
throughout the survey, the third wave also provides biomarker data
for everybody age 45 and above and for a random subsample of individuals
below 45 years. The third wave also provides information on the self-reported
year of diagnosis, information that was missing from the previous
two waves. The sample we use is restricted to the working age population
between age 15 and 64. For our main analysis using self-reported diabetes
we make use of all three waves in order to take advantage of the large
amount of observations and the panel data structure of the data. Our variable of interest for this analysis is self-reported diabetes based on the response to the survey question: ''Have
you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?''. The response to this question
likely suffers from some measurement error, depending on how well
the respondent understands the question, how long ago
a diagnosis might has been made and, most importantly, if the respondent is aware that he has the disease. To investigate how such measurement error might affect the diabetes coefficient in self-reported diabetes we use a random subsample of the 2009-2011 wave of the data which includes biomarker data allowing us to subjectively measure diabetes.
\subsection{\noindent \label{sec:Estimation Strategy}Estimation strategy}

We investigate the relationship of self-reported diabetes and three labour
market outcomes, i.e. employment chances, log hourly wages  and normal
weekly working hours using a fixed effects model. The fixed effect model deals with the problem of unobserved time-invariant
confounders by taking away the group mean for each individual from
both sides of the estimated equation. This will be the main way we investigate the relationship of self-reported
diabetes with labour market outcomes. While using fixed-effects
does not identify a causal relationship as other forms of heterogeneity
could affect our estimates, i.e. time-variant unobserved heterogeneity
or simultaneity, it gives us a better idea of the relationship than
simple cross-sectional data and does allow to control for unobserved
personal characteristics that could bias the estimates without the
drawbacks of an \ac{IV} strategy. We estimate a two-part model where
the model for employment chances takes the following form:

\noindent 
\begin{equation}
Y_{it}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Diabetes_{it}+\beta_{2}X_{it}+c_{i}+\gamma_{t}+u_{it}.\label{eq:employed}
\end{equation}


where $Y_{it}$ is a binary variable taking a value of $1$ if respondent
$i$ reports being employed at time $t$ and $0$ otherwise, $Diabetes_{it}$
is a binary variable taking a value of $1$ if the respondent reports
having ever received a diagnosis of diabetes, $X_{it}$ is a vector
of control variables, $c_{i}$ represents an individual fixed effect,
$\gamma_{t}$ represents a year fixed effect, and $u_{it}$ is the
error term.

For the relationship of self-reported diabetes with log hourly wages
 and weekly working hours models are estimated conditional on being
employed:

\noindent 
\begin{equation}
Y_{it}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Diabetes_{it}+\beta_{2}X_{it}+c_{i}+\gamma_{t}+u_{it}.\label{eq:income_working-hours}
\end{equation}


where $Y_{it}$ is the log hourly wage of respondent $i$ at time
$t$ or in the case of working hours the usual weekly working hours
over the last year. The log hourly wage was calculated by adding up the reported monthly income from the first and potential second job and dividing it by 4.33 which corresponds to the average number of weeks per month in a year with 52 weeks. This gave us the average income per week which we divided by the usual weekly working hours to arrive at an hourly wage estimate\footnote{Labour income was either reported as the total amount for the whole month or if possible more detailed containing information on the monthly wage, income from piecework, tips, extra hours, meals, housing, transport, medical benefits and other earnings. Over 80 percent of respondents reported the total amount instead of a detailed amount. Respondents were also asked for their yearly income and we used that information to arrive at an hourly wage if information for monthly labour income was missing.} Finally, we adjusted the calculated wage for inflation from the year of the interview to 2013.  Working hours are calculated summing up the self-reported usual working hours of the first and potential second job. We dropped observations where the sum of working hours exceeded 112 hours per week, i.e. more than 16 hours of work per day on each day of the week. We deemed these reports to be unreliable and unrealistic and decided to drop them as only 39 observations  where affected. The control variables in both specifications include
age and age squared to capture any non-linearities between age and
labour market outcomes, dummy variables for the effects of any changes
in the living environment of living in a small, medium or large city
with rural and regional dummies for five different Mexican regions\footnote{The region variables have been constructed after recommendations on
the MxFLS-Homepage. South-southeastern Mexico: Oaxaca, Veracruz, Yucatan;
Central Mexico: Federal District of Mexico, State of Mexico, Morelos,
Puebla; Central northeast Mexico: Coahuila, Durango, Nuevo Leon; Central
western Mexico: Guanajuato, Jalisco, Michoacan; Northwest Mexico:
Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, Sonora.} with living in the northeast being the base. We also include a martial
status dummy to control for the impact of marriage on employment chance.
A variable capturing the number of children residing in the household
below the age of 18 is used to control for the impact of children
on labour market outcomes and the effect of childbearing and related
gestational diabetes on the probabilities of developing type 2 diabetes
\citep{Bellamy2009}. To account for the effect that changes in household
wealth might have on diabetes and employment chances, we use the well
established method of principal component analysis of multiple indicators
of household assets and housing conditions to create an indicator
for household wealth \citep{Filmer2001}. The components used for
the construction of the wealth index are detailed in \citet{Seuring2015}.
Year fixed effects are included to capture any changes in the macroeconomic
environment in Mexico over the observed period that could affect employment
chances, wages or working hours and simultaneously the chances to
develop diabetes.

Additionally, we reestimate the above models using a self-reported
measure of the years since diagnosis. First, using a linear specification
indicating the association of our outcomes with each additional year
since diagnosis using the following specification
\noindent 
\begin{equation}
Y_{it}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Dyears_{it}+\beta_{2}X_{it}+c_{i}+\gamma_{t}+u_{it},\label{eq:duration_linear}
\end{equation}

where $\beta_{1}Dyears_{it}$ is a continuous variable indicating years since first diabetes diagnosis.

Second, we use a linear spline function that allows the effect of an additional year with diabetes to vary over time. Doing this we hope to capture possible non-linearities in the relationship of diabetes duration
and labour market outcomes.
\noindent 
\begin{equation}
Y_{it}=\delta_{0}+g(Dyears_{it})+\delta_{2}X_{it}+c_{i}+\gamma_{t}+u_{it}.\label{eq:splines}
\end{equation}


with $g(Dyears_{it})=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\delta_{n}\cdot max\{Dyears_{it}-\eta_{n-1}\}I_{in}$
and $I_{in}=1[\eta_{n-1}\leq Dyears_{it}<\eta_{n}]$, with $\eta_{n}$ being the place of the $n$-th node for $n=1,2,\ldots,N$. We choose three nodes that we think best capture any possible non-linearities in the relationship of diabetes duration and our dependent variables (see Figure Graph in result section). These are located at four, eleven and twenty years after diagnosis. The first four years should capture any immediate effects of the diagnosis, the years five to ten should capture any effects of adaptation to the disease. After eleven years it is conceivable that many of the debilitating complications of diabetes appear that could deteriorate health and lead to adverse effects on our labour market outcomes.  $\delta_{n}$ stands then for the effect of diabetes for the $n$-th interval. Returns are linear if $\delta_{1}=\delta_{2}=,\ldots,=\delta_{n}$.

Because the year of diagnosis was only
reported in the third wave, we could only calculate the duration of
diabetes (or time since diagnosis) for the earlier waves for those
that had also responded to the third wave. To arrive at the time passed
since diagnosis, the year of diagnosis was subtracted from the year
of the interview. Those that reported a diagnosis in the year of the
interview were counted as one year since diagnosis. Accordingly, if
the respondent reported to having been diagnosed in the year before
the interview he was counted as two years since diagnosis. This was
done to have zero years representing people without diabetes and to
use them as the reference category.

Finally, we make use of the biomarker data in wave three, which allows
the exploration of the relationship of undiagnosed diabetes as well
as diabetes severity with labour market outcomes, as measured by \ac{HbA1c}
values. Because this data is only available in the last wave and it
is not possible to use the information in a meaningful way for the
earlier waves, we have to rely on cross-sectional methods. This has the
obvious drawback that we are not able to account for unobserved
heterogeneity using fixed effects. Further, as mentioned before, biomarkers
were only taken from a subsample of about one-third of our original sample
for the third wave, which leaves us with information on 6994 survey
participants. Therefore the analyses cannot be directly compared to
the other results in this paper. Nonetheless, it allows for a first
exploration of the relationships of undiagnosed diabetes as well as
disease severity with labour market outcomes. This is important as
the undiagnosed represent a large part of the diabetes population
in Mexico which has not been explored so far. It further allows us
to explore some of the heterogeneity that exists within the diabetes
population in terms of how well people's diabetes is managed. We first estimate a model to investigate the association of objectively measured diabetes (HbA1c $\leq6.5\%$) with labour market outcomes taking the following form:
\noindent 
\begin{equation}
Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Dobj_{i}+\beta_{2}X_{i}+u_{i}\label{eq:diab_objective}
\end{equation}
where $\beta_{1}Dobj_{i}$ is equal to $1$ if HbA1c $\leq6.5\%$.
In a further step we estimate the following equation
\noindent 
\begin{equation}
Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Dsr_{i}+\beta_{1}Dud_{i}+\beta_{2}X_{i}+u_{i}.\label{eq:diab_sr_ud}
\end{equation}
to investigate how the associations differ between people with diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes. $\beta_{1}Dsr_{i}$ identifies those diagnosed and is equal to $1$ if the person self-reported a diabetes diagnosis.  $\beta_{1}Dud_{i}$ identifies those undiagnosed and is equal to $1$ if the person did not self-report a diabetes diagnosis but has an HbA1c $\leq6.5\%$.
