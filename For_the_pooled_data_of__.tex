For the pooled data of all three waves (Table \ref{tab:Pooled-sample-characteristics}),
diabetes was self-reported by 5 percent of men and 6.2 percent of
women. Most of the respondents in the sample either live in rural
or in large urbanized areas. Looking at our outcome variables, 86
percent of men reported some form of employment compared to 36 percent
of women. Interestingly, men do not report higher hourly wages compared
to women but work more hours per week. Also, men are working more
often in agricultural labour while women are more likely to be self-employed
or in non-agricultural employment. Women also have lower educational
attainments on average. Looking at diabetes, women have a higher self-reported
diabetes prevalence and a longer diabetes duration and also a somewhat
higher mean \ac{HbA1c}.
