\begin{abstract}
Diabetes is increasingly recognized as a major health risk worldwide, including in developing countries. Although adverse economic effects may potentially be large, there is so far limited hard evidence. This paper investigates the effects of diabetes on labour market outcomes focusing on Mexico, a country with high and persistent diabetes. Two challenges present themselves when studying those consequences with survey data: first, causality is hard to identify, and second measurement of diabetes is typically through self-reports, and it is unknown whether this introduces a bias. This paper makes headway on both fronts. To study the relationship between self-reported diabetes and labour outcomes we use rich panel data . Making use of fixed effects estimation, the analysis accounts for time-invariant omitted variables, providing an improved identification strategy compared to existing work on the labor consequences of diabetes in high income countries. The results indicate a strong negative relationship between self-reported diabetes and the probability of employment, which is reduced by 6.5 percentage points for those who self-report to be suffering from diabetes. We find no evidence for an adverse relationship with wages or working hours. Further analysis indicates that each additional year further reduces employment chances, with the adverse relationship strongest after the first ten years since diagnosis. 

We then use biomarker data for a cross section. The results show that the negative relationship remains when using this objective measure , but is smaller in size and is driven by those with diagnosed diabetes. Results are small and insignificant for these with undiagnosed diabetes. This indicates that estimates based on self-reported diabetes overstate the employment effect of diabetes. It also raises the possibility that diagnosis itself has an effect, or that people with certain characteristics self-select into diagnosis.

\section{\label{sec:Introduction}Introduction }

\ac{T2DM} has been increasing worldwide and is expected to continue to do so over the next decades. It has become a problem for \ac{MICs} and \ac{HICs} alike with over two-thirds of people with diabetes living in the developing world \citep{InternationalDiabetesFederation2013}. Mexicans and Mexican-Americans appear to be particularly affected by \ac{T2DM}, both in comparison to other Latino populations elsewhere  and living in the \ac{USA} \citep{Schneiderman2014}. In Mexico itself \ac{T2DM} prevalence has risen from 6.7 percent in 1994 to 14.4 percent in 2006, including both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases \citep{Barquera2013}. This increase stems  both from a deterioration in diet and a reduction in physical activity \citep{Barquera2008b,Basu2013}, as well as from a distinct genetic predisposition of many Mexicans \citep{Williams2013}. \ac{T2DM} has also become the number one cause of death in Mexico \citep{23374611}. Due to its well known health effects, \ac{T2DM} is causing increasing healthcare expenditures and potentially also affects labour market outcomes \citep{Seuring2015a}. Studies for the general \ac{USA} population as well as those focusing on Mexican Americans have found reductions in employment chances as well as wages and labour supply \citep{Brown2005,Brown2014,BrownIII2011,Minor2010,Minor2013}. An earlier cross section analysis for Mexico found a reduction in employment chances of 10 percentage points for Mexican men \citep{Seuring2015} 

However, while these studies have provided good evidence of the potential labour market effects of diabetes many of the complexities of the relationship have remained unaddressed. Diabetes is a term used to describe  various diseases characterized by high blood glucose values, with the predominant disease being \ac{T2DM}, which we will henceforth refer to when using the term diabetes. It is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels due to the body not being able to use insulin properly to maintain blood glucose at normal levels. Elevated blood glucose levels over a prolonged period of time can lead to irreversible health conditions such as heart disease and stroke, blindness, kidney problems, and nerve problems that together with impaired wound healing can lead to the loss of limbs \citep{Reynoso-Noveron2011}. All these conditions can be significantly debilitating and therefore may reduce an individual’s economic activity, including his productivity and labour supply. It is important to bear in mind, however, that diabetes is not a homogeneous
disease and can have different effects on people's health depending
on the success of the long term disease management. On one hand people
who are able to ''reverse'' their diabetes - meaning they manage
to get back to healthy blood glucose levels as a result of lifestyle
changes and medication that successfully re-establish normal insulin sensitivity -
are unlikely to suffer from any diabetes related health problems \citep{Lim2011, Gregg2012}.
On the other hand, if diabetes is either completely untreated or unsuccessfully
treated by medicine or lifestyle changes, and blood glucose levels
and insulin resistance remain elevated, then people are likely to develop the already mentioned adverse health conditions. The temporal aspect of diabetes and the differences in its potential health effects have to be taken into account when investigating its labour market impact. Further, apart from its health effects diabetes might also affect labour market outcomes through other channels. Employers may discriminate against
people with \ac{T2DM} due to their health problems and greater
need for medical treatment. Moreover, people aware of their condition
may also be less inclined to continue working if this interferes with
their management of the disease; they may also use the diagnosis as a justification for withdrawing from work , the so called justification bias \citep{Kapteyn2009}. For these reasons the labour
market effects may also be distinct for people with diagnosed versus those
with undiagnosed diabetes. 

Another challenge with estimating the relationship between diabetes and labour outcomes is unobserved heterogeneity. 
A major source of potential unobserved heterogeneity is related to time-fixed individual unobservables. Personal characteristics such as unobserved abilities, health during uteru, infant and child years – often related to low household income or adverse health shocks during these early years, as well as risk preferences have been shown to adversely affect health and more specifically
the propensity to develop type 2 diabetes \citep{VanEwijk2011,Sotomayor2013,Li2010b},
and may affect employment chances, wages or working hours indirectly
through their adverse effects on educational attainment \citep{Ayyagari2011a}
as well as directly through their effects on today's productivity
\citep{Currie2013}.

The objective of this study is 
to provide new evidence on the impact of diabetes on labour outcomes in \ac{MICs}, while improving upon existing estimation by paying close attention to the above challenges . We use three waves  of panel data from Mexico provided by the \ac{MxFLS} covering the years 2002, 2005-2006 and 2009-2013. The \ac{MxFLS} is particularly useful for the analysis of diabetes and to address the mentioned complexities. First of all, we are able to investigate how self-reported diabetes and self-reported diabetes duration, capturing the temporal dimension of diabetes, are associated with
labour market outcomes using individual level \ac{FE} for the first time in this area, in order to account for any time constant heterogeneity and to provide first evidence of the effects on wages and working hours in a \ac{MIC}. Further, we add to the current literature in exploring the role of undiagnosed diabetes using novel and rich biomarker data, a likely very important issue given the generally large numbers of undiagnosed people (see \citet{Beagley2014}) that remained unobserved in all earlier studies relying on self-reported information. This allows us to say something about the issue of measurement error and about potential differences between diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes. Finally, we assess and try to minimize the issue of inconsistent self-reporting of diabetes over time that could result in measurement error and again has potentially affected the results presented in the earlier literature.

Our results using self-reported diabetes suggest a significant and economically important decrease in employment chances for people aware of their disease of over 6 percentage points for men and women alike. We do not find strong evidence for any further effects of diabetes on wages or working hours, but show that if unobserved heterogeneity is unaccounted for the estimates are biased and suggest a positive association of diabetes with wages. We further find that employment chances are reduced with each additional year since diagnosis by over one percentage point and some evidence for an even larger effect per year after the initial 10 years. 

Turning to the biomarker analysis we find that measurement error of self-reported diabetes leads to an upward biased estimate of the employment penalty compared to objectively measured diabetes including those diagnosed and undiagnosed. We further find no effect of undiagnosed diabetes on any labour market outcome suggesting that adverse effects only occur to those with a diagnosis. We conclude that people aware of their diabetes differ from those unaware of the disease leading to the different outcomes for both groups and argue that other unobserved characteristics, such as those related to the added health information of a diagnosis may play an important role and need further exploration. Of course differences in other adverse health events related to diabetes not captured by the data likely also explain much of the difference between diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes. Finally, we do not find that current diabetes severity as proxied by \ac{HbA1c} measurements is related to labour market outcomes.

In general, our results are consistent with the temporal way in which diabetes is affecting the health of people. They indicate that those with a diagnosis experience an important employment penalty once they are diagnosed, potentially due to the psychological effects of the diagnosis but also because diabetes is not diagnosed at the initial stage of the disease but after several years of asymptomatic but elevated blood glucose levels. A possible explanation would be that a diagnosis frequently happens after some time of living with elevated blood glucose levels shortly before or once symptoms start appearing   which then, potentially in conjunction with psychological effects of the diagnosis, and possibly discriminatory employer behaviour , reduce employment chances shortly after. In line with that we find that the adverse effects are even stronger several years after diagnosis likely due to the development of additional and more severe complications. 


\section{\label{sec:Related literature} Labour Outcomes and Diabetes literature}

Several studies have investigated the effects of diabetes on labour market outcomes. For the USA, \citet{Brown2005}  estimated the impact of the disease on employment in 1996--1997 in an older population of Mexican Americans in the \ac{US} close to the Mexican border, using a recursive bivariate probit model. They found diabetes to be endogenous for women but not for men. The results of the \ac{IV} estimation suggested no significant effect on women which, compared to the adverse effect found in the probit model, indicated an overestimation of the effect for women when endogeneity was not accounted for. For men, the probit estimates showed a significant adverse effect of about 7 percentage points. For a similar population and using biomarker data, \citet{BrownIII2011} looked at how diabetes management, inferred from measured \ac{HbA1c} levels,
affected employment chances and wages using cross-sectional data in
a mainly Mexican-American population in the US. They found a linear adverse association of increasing \ac{HbA1c} levels with
employment chances and with wages for men. They did, however, not investigate the effects of undiagnosed diabetes. Two other studies also investigated the effect of diabetes on employment and productivity for the USA. \citet{Minor2010} investigated the effect of diabetes on female employment, earnings, working hours and lost work days in the \ac{US} in 2006. The study found diabetes to be endogenous and underestimated if exogeneity was assumed. In the \ac{IV} estimates, type 2 diabetes had a significant negative effect on female employment chances as well as yearly earnings but not on working hours. Both of these studies used a Heckman selection model to adjust for a possible selection bias in their estimates of productivity. However, since the studies do not report identifying variables, the identification seems to hinge solely on the non-linearity of the selection correction term, which has been shown to be unsatisfactory. . In a later study \citet{Minor2013}
finds  some evidence for a non-linear relationship of \ac{T2DM} duration
and employment two to five years after diagnosis for men and eleven
to fifteen years after diagnosis for women. He finds evidence for
an adverse linear relationship of years since diagnosis with employment
for females but not for males. For wages he finds no indication of
any linear effects of diabetes duration but a reduction in male wages
in the non-linear specification six to ten years after diagnosis.
However, apart from the non-linear effects found for employment chances,
the found effects were only significant at the 10 percent significance
level. This analysis did not adjust for a possible non-random selection into employment and relied on a two-part model. 
For Canada, \citet{Latif2009} estimated the effect of the disease on employment probabilities. Contrary to \citet{Brown2005}, he found diabetes to be exogenous for females and endogenous for males; taking this into account he obtained a significant negative impact on the employment probabilities for women, but not for men. Because the simple probit model showed a significant negative effect for males, \citet{Latif2009} concluded that not accounting for 
endogeneity resulted in an overestimation of the effect on male employment chances. For Australia, \cite{Zhang2009} investigate the effects of various chronic diseases,including diabetes, on labour force participation using a multivariate endogeneous probit model. They find reduced labour market participation for males and females of 7.1 and 9 percentage points, respectively. They also find, that if the endogeneity of diabetes is unaccounted for the effects are overestimated. 

Only two studies exist for \ac{MIC}. \citet{Liu2014} investigate the effect of a recent diabetes diagnosis on labour income
in China exploiting a natural experiment for identification and find a
significant reduction in income for those with a recent diagnosis.
An earlier study for Mexico, investigated the effect of self-reported
diabetes on the probability of employment using cross-sectional data from the
2005 wave of the \ac{MxFLS}, and found a significant (p<0.01) reduction
in employment chances for males of a about 10 percentage points and
for females of about 4.5 percentage points, albeit at a much lower
statistical significance,using parental diabetes as an \ac{IV} \citep{Seuring2015}.

A recent systematic review of the economic cost of diabetes confirms that the evidence from \ac{MICs} remains  scarce \citep{Seuring2015a}, while most studies, including those on high income countries, suffer from two key limitations. First, many studies rely exclusively on cross-sectional data , unable to fully account for unobserved characteristics. 

Second,  many studies apply an \ac{IV} estimation 
strategy, typically using parental diabetes as instrument. 
Second, many studies use. The use of this instrument relies on the finding that type 2 diabetes has a genetic and heritable component that could theoretically provide valid identification of the true effect of diabetes. However, it remains unclear whether the variable fully satisfies the exclusion restriction, as it may also proxy other genetically transferred traits, including those that impact labor outcomes directly, like for instance unobserved abilities.

The identification also abstracts from intrahousehold or intergenerational labour supply effects. It is conceivable that diabetes might deteriorate parental health in such a way that the offspring either has to give
up their employment to provide care, or inversely, increase labour supply to compensate for lost income \citep{Seuring2015}. Instrumentation can further be problematic if the instruments are weak as their use may result in biased estimates in finite samples and generally produce large standard errors \citep{Bound1995}. 

To address these limitations, this paper applies an alternative panel estimation strategy using individual level \ac{FE} , potentially better accounting for unobserved heterogeneity without having to rely on the strong assumptions of an \ac{IV} strategy. Using the \ac{MxFLS} we are able to investigate
how self-reported diabetes and diabetes duration are associated with
labour market outcomes using \ac{FE} and investigate the heterogeneity
of the effects across different employment types, i.e.
non-agricultural employment, agricultural employment and self-employment, as ill health may have distinct effects than across these activities. Finally, we provide explore how labour outcomes are related with undiagnosed diabetes, using information from a large biomarker sample. This provides additional information on the substantial part of the
population unaware of they are suffering from diabetes.





\section{\label{sec:Data}Data}



The dataset used for the empirical analysis is the \acf{MxFLS},
a nationally representative, longitudinal household survey with three
waves conducted in 2002, 2005--2006 and 2009--2011, respectively.
All household members aged 15 and above were interviewed, and information
on a wide range of social, demographic, economic characteristics and
health behaviours of the individuals and their families was collected
\citep{Rubalcava2013}. Apart from self-reported diabetes information
throughout the survey, we more specifically use information provided exclusively in the most recent wave, i.e. information
on the self-reported year of diagnosis as well as biomarker data including \ac{HbA1c} levels for a large proportion of respondents.  For our main analysis
using self-reported diabetes we exploit all three waves in order to
take advantage of the large amount of observations (N=49,323) and the panel structure
of the data. Our variable of interest for this analysis is self-reported
diabetes based on the survey question: ''Have you
ever been diagnosed with diabetes?''. The response to this question
likely suffers from measurement error depending on how long ago a diagnosis
might have been made and, most importantly, if the respondent is aware
that he has the disease. In order to investigate how such measurement
error may affect estimates of the labour market impact of diabetes
we use the random subsample with over 6000 respondents of the 2009-2011 wave, allowing us to use objectively measured diabetes by identifying those with undiagnosed diabetes. For the entire paper the used samples are restricted to the working age population of Mexicans age 15 to 64. To prevent that pregnant women might bias our results due to the increased diabetes risk during pregnancy and its effects on female employment status, we have dropped all observations of women reporting to be pregnant at the time of the survey (N=764).



As can be observed in Figure \ref{fig:Self-reported-diabetes-prevalenc},
unweighted self-reported diabetes prevalence in the \ac{MxFLS}
has increased from about 6 percent in 2002 to 7.1 percent in 2009
for females and from about 4.3 to 5.7 percent for males. This is
still well below the diabetes prevalence estimates published by other
institutions, including the \ac{IDF}, whose most recent estimates for 2014 indicate a prevalence of about 12 percent (which amounts to about 9 million Mexicans) for those aged between 20 and 79 \citep{InternationalDiabetesFederation2013}.
However, this difference in self-reported and undiagnosed diabetes should be explained, in addition to the somewhat different age group considered, by the large share of undiagnosed people in the sample. \citet{Barquera2013} show that while overall prevalence in Mexico increased from 6.7 percent in 1994 to 7.5 percent in 2000 and 14.4 percent in 2006, only 4.6, 5.8 and 7.5 percent, respectively, had been previously diagnosed. Accordingly, the prevalence based on diabetes self-reports in our sample is more or less in line with other existing data from Mexico. Further, we will, specifically investigate the actual extent of undiagnosed diabetes further below, using the \ac{MxFLS} data.

prevalence in MxFLS}
\end{figure}

For the pooled data of all three waves (Table \ref{tab:Pooled-sample-characteristics}),
diabetes was self-reported by 5 percent of men and 6.2 percent of
women. Most of the respondents in the sample either live in rural
or in large urbanized areas. Looking at our outcome variables, 86
percent of men report some form of employment compared to 36 percent
of women. Interestingly, men do not report higher hourly wages compared
to women but work more hours per week. Also, men are working more
often in agricultural jobs while women are more likely to be self-employed
or in non-agricultural employment. Women also have lower educational
attainments on average. Looking at diabetes, women have a higher self-reported
diabetes prevalence.

When looking at the descriptive statistics from the subsample of the third wave (2009-2012) containing biomarker data in Table \ref{tab:Biomarker-sample-characteristics}, it first has to be noted that in this subsample respondents are somewhat older on average than in the pooled sample, which can be explained by the fact that everybody above the age of 44 was included and only a random subsample of those younger \cite{Crimmins2015}. Also, self-reported diabetes is much higher than in the pooled sample as well as in the full sample of wave 3. Regarding the other control and outcome variables, the sample is pretty similar to the pooled sample. The added value of this subsample is obviously the biomarker information regarding diabetes. Apparently a large share of the subsample has an \ac{HbA1c} indicative of diabetes.\footnote{In one of the first analyses of these new biomarker data \citet{Frankenberg2015} show that the rates in Mexico of elevated ac{HbA1c} levels are very high when compared to \ac{HbA1c} data from similar surveys in the \ac{USA} and China and note that "The extremely high levels of elevated HbA1c among Mexicans adults (...) is profoundly troubling.".} In the sample used in this study over 18 percent of males and females are undiagnosed. These first descriptive results suggest that using self-reported diabetes as a measure for diabetes in Mexico can lead to a strong underestimate of the true diabetes population which potentially has consequences for the interpretation of empirical results of economic studies using self-reported diabetes data. In the ensuing sections we will therefore try to shed some light on how taking the large undiagnosed population into account could affect the estimates of diabetes in relation to labour outcomes.

\section{\label{sec:Estimation Strategy}Estimation Strategy}

  
The conceptual framework of our study is based on the work of \citet{Strauss1998},  who specify the following model to conceptualize the relationship of health and wages.
\begin{equation}
w=w(H;S,A,B,I,\alpha,e_{w})\label{eq:wage}
\end{equation}
where $w$ is the real wage; $H$ is an array of measured health human capital; $S$ is education; $A$ is a vector of demographic characteristics; $B$ is the family background of the individual; $I$ is local community infrastructure; $\alpha$ is an array of unobservables such as ability and $e_w$ is measurement error of wages. 

There are several ways diabetes may affect $H$. First of all, diabetes can deteriorate health if it remains untreated with the adverse effects increasing over time. Second, a diagnosis of diabetes and ensuing treatment may lead to better health compared to the undiagnosed state, however, compared to healthy people even those with diabetes receiving treatment may still have worse health outcomes. Third, there is also evidence that the diagnosis itself may affect one's own health perception and can lead to worse self-perceived health \citep{17003303}. We therefore expect diabetes to adversely affect health and consequently labour market outcomes.

When estimating equation  \ref{eq:wage} empirically with observational data, unobserved heterogeneity may bias the results. As mentioned in section  \ref{sec:Introduction} unobserved factors captured in $\alpha$ such as early childhood investments, innate ability and time preference could affect productivity at work as well as the probability to develop diabetes. Further, changes in lifestyle due to changes in wages or employment status may also affect the probability to develop diabetes via  less healthy diet and physical activity patterns. Finally, measurement error $e_w$ may be an important issue due to the large undiagnosed population with diabetes, particularly if being diagnosed is related to employment or wages via better access to healthcare through employment benefits and higher income. In the following section we will show how we will deal with these issues in our estimation strategy.


\subsubsection{Panel data estimation strategy: Self-reported Diabetes}

We investigate the relationship of self-reported diabetes and three
labour market outcomes, i.e. employment chances, log hourly wages
and normal weekly working hours using a fixed effects model. While using individual level \ac{FE} does not fully
identify a causal relationship, as other forms of heterogeneity could
affect our estimates (i.e. via time-variant unobserved heterogeneity
or simultaneity) it does improve on the degree of causal inference,
compared to a simple cross-sectional analysis, and in particular it
does allow to control for unobserved personal characteristics that
could bias the estimates, without the drawbacks of a less than convincing
\ac{IV} strategy that has been widely applied in this literature. 
For comparison purposes we also present the results of the respective random effects models that assume no unobserved heterogeneity.

We estimate a two-part model where the model for employment chances
takes the following form:

\noindent 
\begin{equation}
Y_{it}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Diabetes_{it}+\beta_{2}X_{it}+c_{i}+\gamma_{t}+u_{it}.\label{eq:employed}
\end{equation}


where $Y_{it}$ is a binary variable taking a value of $1$ if respondent
$i$ reports being employed at time $t$ and $0$ otherwise, $Diabetes_{it}$
is a binary variable taking a value of $1$ at time $t$ if the respondent
reports having ever received a diagnosis of diabetes, $X_{it}$ is
a vector of control variables, $c_{i}$ represents an individual fixed
effect, $\gamma_{t}$ represents a year fixed effect, and $u_{it}$
is the error term.

For the relationship of self-reported diabetes with log hourly wages
and weekly working hours models are estimated conditional on having positive wages and being
employed, respectively. In these models $Y_{it}$ represents the log hourly wage
of respondent $i$ at time $t$ or the usual weekly working hours
over the last year.

The log hourly wage was calculated by adding up the reported monthly
income from the first and potential second job and dividing it by
4.33 which corresponds to the average number of weeks per month in
a year with 52 weeks. This gave us the average earnings per week which
was then divided by the usual weekly working hours to arrive at an
hourly wage estimate\footnote{Labour income was either reported as the total amount for the whole
month or if possible more detailed containing information on the monthly
wage, income from piecework, tips, extra hours, meals, housing, transport,
medical benefits and other earnings. Over 80 percent of respondents
reported the total amount instead of a detailed amount. Respondents
were also asked for their yearly income and we used that information
to arrive at an hourly wage if information for monthly labour income
was missing.} Finally, we adjusted the calculated wage for inflation from the year
of the interview up to 2013. Working hours were calculated summing
up the self-reported usual working hours of the first and potential
second job. We dropped 39 observations where the sum of working hours
exceeded 112 hours per week, i.e. more than 16 hours of work per day
on each day of the week as we deemed these reports to be unrealistic.
Due to a considerable number of missing values the sample used for the wage estimation is considerably smaller than the model for working hours.

The control variables in both \ac{FE} specifications include dummy variables for the effects of any changes in the living environment
of living in a small, medium or large city with rural and state
dummies capturing the effects of moving to a different state. We also include a marital
status dummy to control for the impact of marriage on employment chances.
A variable capturing the number of children residing in the household
below the age of 18 is used to control for the impact of children
on labour market outcomes and the effect of childbearing and related
gestational diabetes on the probability of developing type 2 diabetes
\citep{Bellamy2009}. To account for the effect that changes in household
wealth might have on diabetes and employment chances, we use standard
principal component analysis of multiple indicators of household assets
and housing conditions to create an indicator for household wealth
\citep{Filmer2001}. The components used for the construction of the
wealth index are detailed in \citet{Seuring2015}. Finally, calender year fixed effects are included to capture the effects of increasing age and any macroeconomic shocks over time.

Additionally, we estimate models using a self-reported
measure of the years since diagnosis instead. First, using a linear specification
indicating the association of labour market  outcomes with each additional
year since diagnosis, using the following specification:

\begin{equation}
Y_{it}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Dyears_{it}+\beta_{2}X_{it}+c_{i}+\gamma_{t}+u_{it},\label{eq:duration_linear}
\end{equation}


\noindent where $\beta_{1}Dyears_{it}$ is a continuous variable indicating
years since first diabetes diagnosis.

Second, to capture possible non-linearities in the relationship of interest we use a spline function that allows the effect
of an additional year with diabetes to vary over time. We do this. 
\begin{equation}
Y_{it}=\delta_{0}+g(Dyears_{it})+\delta_{2}X_{it}+c_{i}+\gamma_{t}+u_{it}.\label{eq:splines}
\end{equation}


\noindent with $g(Dyears_{it})=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\delta_{n}\cdot max\{Dyears_{it}-\eta_{n-1}\}I_{in}$
and $I_{in}=1[\eta_{n-1}\leq Dyears_{it}<\eta_{n}]$, with $\eta_{n}$
being the place of the $n$-th node for $n=1,2,\ldots,N$. We choose
three nodes that - based on visual inspection (see Figures \ref{fig:Kernel-weighted-local-polynomial_empl}, \ref{fig:Kernel-weighted-local-polynomial_wage} and \ref{fig:Kernel-weighted-local-polynomial_workhrs} in the
result section) - best captured any possible non-linearities in the
relationship of diabetes duration and our dependent variables. These
are located at four, eleven and twenty years after diagnosis. The
first four years should capture any immediate effects of the diagnosis,
the years five to eleven should capture any effects of adaptation to
the disease. After eleven years it is conceivable that many of the
debilitating complications of diabetes would appear that could deteriorate
health and lead to adverse effects on our labour market outcomes.
The coefficient$\delta_{n}$ captures the effect of diabetes for the
$n$-th interval. The effects are linear if $\delta_{1}=\delta_{2}=,\ldots,=\delta_{n}$.

Because the year of diagnosis was only reported in the third wave,
duration of diabetes (or time since diagnosis)
for the earlier waves was only calculated for those that had also responded to the third
wave. To arrive at the time passed since diagnosis, the year of diagnosis
was subtracted from the year of the interview. In order to have zero years representing people without a self-reported  diagnosis those that reported
a diagnosis in the year of the interview were counted as 'one year
since diagnosis'. Accordingly, if the respondent reported to having
been diagnosed in the year before the interview he or she was counted
as 'two years since diagnosis' and so on.

As  a robustness check of our results of the linear probability model for employment status, we also estimate population-averaged panel-data model with the probit link function. To account for fixed unobserved heterogeneity in this type of model we use the 'within-between' formulation proposed by \citet{Bell2015} which is based on the work of \citet{Mundlak1978}, which allows to account for time-constant unobserved heterogeneity by adding the individual group means as regressors. The 'within-between' formulation also adds group means but uses the demeaned values instead of the complete observation to capture any within variation. This has some advantages as it allows to differentiate clearly between the within and the between effects of the used variables and is less prone to issues of collinearity and multicollinearity. Using this
strategy has yielded qualitatively similar results to those of the
linear fixed effects specifications and the results are available
on request.

\subsubsection{Cross-section data estimation strategy: biomarker and self-reported data}

Self-reported diabetes only captures part of the diabetes population as many individuals remain undiagnosed.  Estimations based on self-reports may therefore suffer from a selection bias. We use the biomarker data in wave three to explore the relationship of measured diabetes, including undiagnosed diabetes with labour outcomes. The biomarker data also allows us to look at diabetes severity , as measured
by \ac{HbA1c} values. Since this data is only available for one wave - the
last wave, we focus on a cross-section analysis . Moreover,
as mentioned above, biomarkers were only taken from a subsample  of the initial representative sample - 
about one-third of the sample , which leaves
us with information on 6994 survey participants. Therefore the analyses
cannot be directly compared to the panel-based results in this paper.
Nonetheless, it allows for a first exploration of the relationships
of undiagnosed diabetes as well as disease severity with labour market
outcomes.  It further allows us to explore
some of the heterogeneity that may exist within the diabetes population
in terms of how well different people manage their diabetes condition.
We first estimate a model to investigate the association of objectively
measured diabetes (HbA1c $\geq6.5\%$) with labour market outcomes
taking the following form: 
\begin{equation}
Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Dobj_{i}+\beta_{2}X_{i}+u_{i}\label{eq:diab_objective}
\end{equation}
where $\beta_{1}Dobj_{i}$ is equal to $1$ if HbA1c $\geq6.5\%$.
In a further step we estimate the following equation 
\begin{equation}
Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Dsr_{i}+\beta_{1}Dud_{i}+\beta_{2}X_{i}+u_{i}.\label{eq:diab_sr_ud}
\end{equation}
to investigate how the associations differ between people with diagnosed
and undiagnosed diabetes. $\beta_{1}Dsr_{i}$ identifies those diagnosed
and is equal to $1$ if the person self-reported a diabetes diagnosis.
$\beta_{1}Dud_{i}$ identifies those undiagnosed and is equal to $1$
if the person did not self-report a diabetes diagnosis but has an
HbA1c $\geq6.5\%$.


\subsection{Estimation bias}

Self-reported data can suffer from non-classical measurement error
due to systematic misreporting which has been shown to cause estimates
of economic outcomes to be biased and overstated \citep{Cawley2015,ONeill2013,Perks2015}.
In most survey data diabetes it is typically measured by a self-reported diabetes
diagnosis which can suffer from two forms of measurement
error: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Systematic overreporting of diabetes:} people without diabetes
could intentionally report a diabetes diagnosis with a view to justifying
some other adverse event or status in their life (e.g. being unemployed). 
\item \textbf{Systematic underreporting of diabetes:} it is conceivable
that people with diabetes are ashamed of their disease and therefore
do not report it. Further, it has been shown that diabetes often remains
undiagnosed for long periods of time or is not diagnosed at all, potentially
leaving many people unaware of the disease which hence results in
the non-report of the disease.
\end{enumerate} 

It is difficult to quantify the direction of a resulting bias. Overreporting
could attenuate the coefficient of diabetes as those falsely reporting a diabetes diagnosis experience no adverse health
effects of diabetes that could adversely affect labour outcomes. However, if some of those misreports were
made in order to justify some other adverse event, e.g. current unemployment
or other health problems, then this could potentially lead to an overestimation
of the true effect of diabetes on employment. Underreporing due to
a non-diagnosis could cause either an overestimation or attenuation
bias: it would lead to an overestimation if people with undiagnosed
diabetes were generally healthier and therefore more likely to have
positive labour market outcomes than people with diagnosed diabetes
and would therefore have attenuated the effect of diabetes if they
were observed in the data. Yet, because they are unobserved the effect
of diabetes using self-reports may be overstated. However, if those
with undiagnosed diabetes were very similar in terms of health to those with
diagnosed diabetes and consequently experienced similar health problems
that adversely affected their labour market outcomes, then this would lead to an attenuation of the diabetes coefficient as the control group without observed diabetes, i.e. including people with undiagnosed
diabetes, were on average less healthy and have worse labour market outcomes than it
would have had if all diabetes cases had been observed.

In this context, however, an important additional issue arises with the potential effect that being informed via a diabetes diagnosis
might have on labour market outcomes. In assessing the labour market
effects of diabetes with the help of self-reported diabetes as our
diabetes indicator, we need to be aware that we are likely measuring
something else then the pure health effects of diabetes. A diabetes
diagnosis is likely to also affect an individual's psychology and
health behaviour which in turn could have its own effects on economic
outcomes. One study found a diabetes diagnosis and subsequent treatment
to increase the odds of psychological problems, including depression
and anxiety \citep{17003303}. Other research has also shown that
anxiety and depression increase with the number of diabetes symptoms
people with diabetes self-report after a diagnosis \cite{Paddison_2011}.
Interestingly, similar results have not been found for people with
undiagnosed diabetes \citep{Nouwen2011}. When looking at economic
studies of the effect of a diabetes diagnosis, \citet{Liu2014} found
that receiving a diabetes diagnosis considerably reduced labour income
in Chinese employees shortly after their diagnosis. Similarly, others
have shown that a hypertension diagnosis can affect health
behaviours, i.e. a reduce fat intake \citep{Zhao2013a}. Similar effects have also been found
for the US, in that people receiving a diabetes diagnosis changed
their health behaviours favourably, albeit only over the short term
\citep{Slade2012}. It is not difficult to imagine that such changes in
health behaviours resulting from a diabetes diagnosis might also translate
into changes in employment chances or productivity, on top of a potential
effects resulting from the diabetes-related health changes. Hence, the labour market effects we measure with self-reported diabetes are likely different from those
that we would measure based on a purely medical assessment of diabetes
obtained from blood tests, not only due to measurement error but also
due to the additional information effects of the diagnosis itself.

\subsection{Strategies to deal with measurement error}

As discussed above, reporting error is likely to pose a considerable
challenge in the use of self-reported data. Fortunately, the \ac{MxFLS}
data provides several possibilities to assess the amount of misreporting
as well as to partly correct it, in the attempt to reduce any resulting
bias when estimating the labour market effects of diabetes. In what
follows we describe our approach of dealing with inconsistencies in
self-reported diabetes over time.

One of the key advantages of panel data is in its repeated measurement
for many of the individuals, thereby allowing to uncover inconsistencies
for those individuals with at least two observations. While we are
not aware of any literature investigating the issue of inconsistencies
in self-reported diabetes over time, a study by \citet{Zajacova2010}
on the consistency of a self-reported cancer diagnosis over time in
a US population found that 30 percent of those who had reported a
cancer diagnosis at an earlier point, did report at a later point
that they never had received a cancer diagnosis. They also found that
a more recent diagnosis was reported with greater consistency possibly
due to increasing recall problems and/or reduced salience as time
since diagnosis progresses.

We find similar inconsistencies in the diabetes self-reports over
the three waves of the \ac{MxFLS} data, with between 10 to 20 percent
of those reporting diabetes in one wave not reporting diabetes in
one of the subsequent waves. In order to correct these inconsistencies we were interested in the validity of diabetes elf-reports. While we could not find a study assessing
the validity of self-reported diabetes in Mexico, a study from China
has shown that specificity of self-reported diabetes - meaning that
those who self-report a diabetes diagnosis actually have diabetes
- was very high (>98 percent for China), while sensitivity - a measure
of how many people with diabetes, diagnosed or undiagnosed, actually
self-report the disease- was low (40 percent for China) \citep{Yuan2015}.
This indicates that people who report a diabetes diagnosis are likely
to indeed have the condition while many of those not reporting
a diabetes diagnosis could have diabetes as well but are unaware.

Thanks to the biomarker data provided in the third wave of the \ac{MxFLS},
we are also able to assess the validity of self-reported diabetes
by using \ac{HbA1c} levels and the self-reports of diabetes
related medicine use. The \ac{WHO}
recommends a cut-off value of an \ac{HbA1c} $\geq6.5$ percent
to diagnose a person with diabetes \citep{WorldHealthOrganization2011}.
Of the subsample selected for biomarker measurements and answering
the diabetes question (n=6895), 705 reported a diabetes diagnosis
and of those 632 (90 percent) had an \ac{HbA1c} $\geq6.5$ percent
or did report taking diabetes medication, indicating relatively high specificity in our data as well.

We therefore assumed for people with information from only two waves, that if
they reported a diabetes diagnosis in a prior wave they also had diabetes
in the ensuing wave even if they did not report a diabetes diagnosis.
For people where we had data from all three waves, we used that
additional information to make a decision on how to deal with inconsistencies
using the rules outlined in Table \ref{tab:Inconsistencies}:

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}

\begin{adjustbox}{max width=\textwidth}

\end{tabular}
\end{adjustbox}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{tab:Inconsistencies}\textbf{Inconsistencies in diabetes self-report
in MxFLS}}
\end{table}


This approach should add more consistency to the self-reported diabetes
information by using all available information. We tested if the results
of the \ac{HbA1c} tests for the subpopulation in 2009 with biomarker
information and inconsistencies in their diabetes reporting (n=96,
48 with two and 48 with one self-report of diabetes) would support
this decision. Therefore we compared the mean \ac{HbA1c} values for those
who had two self-reports of a diagnosis of diabetes in the full three
waves with those with only one self-report. Using a t-test we found
a significantly (p<0.001) higher mean \ac{HbA1c} of 9.6 percent
for those with two self-reports compared to 7.0 percent for those
with only one self-report of diabetes. Further, of those with one
self-report, only 30 percent had an \ac{HbA1c}$\geq6.5$ percent
compared to 87 percent of those with two self-reports. Bases on these results we were reassured that the way we have dealt with the inconsistencies in the data should
minimize misclassification of people into diabetes or no-diabetes
and should reduce some of the measurement error in the diabetes data. Unfortunately we cannot use a similar method for dealing with inconsistencies
in the self-reported year of diabetes diagnosis as it has only been reported once. Hence, the results from models using
duration of diabetes instead of self-reported diabetes must be interpreted
particularly carefully.

We also want to stress, that despite our efforts to reduce any bias in our estimates we do not make any causal claims as the used methods cannot prove causation. While the fixed effects model accounts for time invariant
unobserved confounders, it is still possible that the estimates are biased
due to important time variant heterogeneity we did not account for, or
due to labour market outcomes simultaneously affecting the chances to develop or
being diagnosed with diabetes. For example changes in lifestyle due to
employment or unemployment could affect the probabilities of developing
diabetes which then in turn could affect labour market outcomes. Another pathway could be high stress levels at
work that have been shown to have a positive association with
diabetes incidence for obese women and a negative association for
non-obese men \citep{Heraclides2012,Eriksson2013}. However, part
of the possible effects of work stress on diabetes should be accounted
for by our fixed effects model. Genetics play an important role for
the development of type 2 diabetes and it is likely that people with
a genetic predisposition are more likely to develop diabetes related
to stress. Further, coping mechanism related to stress are also likely
to differ between persons depending on their genetics and coping
methods learned early in life \citep{Schneiderman2005}, so that our
fixed effect technique should account for these time invariant factors
and reduce the possible bias. Also the literature on the effects of employment
status on diabetes so far has not found strong adverse effects of being laid
off on diabetes self-reports \citep{Bergemann2011,Schaller2015},
albeit only for high-income countries.

\section{\label{sec:RESULTS} Results}


\subsection{Panel data analysis}

\subsubsection*{Self-reported diabetes}

Table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-and} presents the estimation
results of the \ac{FE} model \ref{eq:employed}.
The results indicate significant and substantial reductions in employment
chances for people with self-reported diabetes. The effects are surprisingly similar between males and females showing a reduction in
employment chances of around 6.5 percentage points. The adverse effects on employment confirm findings of an earlier study on Mexico by \cite{Seuring2015} albeit we now find a stronger indication of an effect for females. This earlier study used an \ac{IV} approach and found diabetes to be exogenous in the determination of employment chances, a finding which is supported by the small difference between our \ac{RE} and \ac{FE} estimates for employment chances.

\end{table}

While the adverse relationship between self-reported diabetes and
employment chances appears to be quite strong, we find no evidence
for any relationship with wages or working hours using the \ac{FE} specification. Further, comparing the results with the \ac{RE} model, we see that there are no stark differences for employment chances but that the \ac{FE} model appears to correct for a positive bias in the effect of diabetes on wages. The \ac{RE} model suggests that men with diabetes earn more than men without diabetes which is an unintuitive finding. Controlling for fixed unobservables, however, the positive effect disappears and becomes insignificant suggesting that assuming exogeneity of diabetes leads to biased estimates of wages. A potential explanation is that men a comparatively higher innate ability are able to earn higher wages and at the same time to better manage their diabetes preventing them from dropping out of the labour market due to health reasons. They may also be more valuable to their employers preventing them from being dismissed even if the employer would normally discriminate against people with diabetes.



To investigate whether there are differences in
wages and working hours between different types of work, we estimate
a model including interaction terms between self-reported diabetes
and agricultural employment and between self-reported diabetes and
self-employment, respectively, using non-agricultural employment as
the base. There would be reason to expect the relationship between
diabetes and labour market outcomes to differ with the type of work:
the health consequences of diabetes could affect the productivity
of workers by reducing their physical abilities. Accordingly, people
with diabetes working in an agricultural job that requires strenuous,
physical efforts to work the land could see their productivity to be
more adversely affected by diabetes than those working in an office,
hence being less physically active.

As Table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-interaction} shows, male
agricultural workers have lower wages generally, but the relationship
between diabetes remains unaffected by the type of work. The only
statistically more relevant relationship that we find relates to working
hours of agricultural workers with diabetes, who appear to work about
6 hours less than non-agricultural workers without self-reported diabetes.
However, because we have more than two work types we cannot draw conclusions
solely on the basis of the t-statistic. We therefore perform a Wald
test for the overall significance of the interaction term which does
not reject the null of no interaction effects, suggesting that the
effect of diabetes on working hours does not vary significantly by type of work.
When stratified by gender, standard errors become larger, which should
be explained by the small number of observations of females with diabetes
reporting working hours in agricultural employment (n=10) compared
to men (n=139). Overall, we find no evidence for an association of
self-reported diabetes and wages or working hours.

Finally, we explore if diabetes affects the selection into different types of work distinctively. We refrain from using a fixed effects multinomial logit model due to the problems surrounding the calculation of interpretable marginal effects in this case \citep{Pforr2014}. We instead estimate fixed effects models of the probability of being in non-agricultural employment, agricultural employment or self-employment using three dummy variables indicating the respective type of work as the dependent variable.\footnote{For example, "non-agricultural employment" is coded as $1$ if the respondent is engaged in agricultural work and is coded as $0$ for those unemployed, in non-agricultural employment or self-employed. This is repeated for the dummy variables "agricultural employment" and "self-employed".} The results in table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-selection_LPM} indicate that for men diabetes mainly appears to be associated with reduced employment chances for those self-employed and for women an adverse association is found for those in agricultural and self-employment. This could suggest that having diabetes drives people out of self-employment and agricultural jobs, potentially because these jobs are more physically demanding than other forms of work and likely also because they provide less protection in terms of insurance and formal employment. We interpret the fact that the coefficient signs are negative for all types of work as an indication that people with diabetes predominantly become unemployed rather than to sort into other types of work that would be better suited for them given their health [DOES THIS INTERPRETATION MAKE SENSE?].

\subsubsection*{Self-reported diabetes duration}

Because diabetes is a chronic and generally life-long disease, we investigate how soon after the first diagnosis diabetes may affect labour market outcomes. Given that complications of diabetes develop over time it could be that the effect increases
linearly as the years go by. However, non-linear relationships
are also imaginable as psychological effects of the immediate diagnosis
as well as the likely health problems that led to the diagnosis could
affect labour market outcomes immediately after a person has been
diagnosed. They could then level off later as people with diabetes
develop their skills in managing and living with the disease. Contrary, if diabetes management is unsuccessful a longer disease duration likely leads to significant diabetes complications so that the adverse labour market effects of diabetes may appear at a later disease stage.

In order to obtain a first idea of the non parametric relationship
we use kernel-weighted local polynomial regression to graph the relationship
between our outcome variables and diabetes duration. As Figure \ref{fig:Kernel-weighted-local-polynomial_empl}
shows, the relationship of diabetes duration and employment chances
seems to be more or less linear for the pooled sample, showing a steady
decline, though less so when separated by gender. We find a first
decline in employment probabilities for men after about seven years
which continues to about twenty years post-diagnosis. For women,
a first drop off occurs right after diagnosis and thereafter no consistent
pattern can be observed. However, the displayed relationships after
twenty years suffer from large standard errors (not shown here) as sample size is reduced
considerably limiting the interpretation of the relationship for those with a very long disease duration. A similar analysis for wages and working hours shows
somewhat more erratic relationships, especially after the first twelve
years (see figures \ref{fig:Kernel-weighted-local-polynomial_wage} and \ref{fig:Kernel-weighted-local-polynomial_workhrs}). In an effort to best capture any non-linearities for the pooled
and gender stratifies samples, we created the following splines to
capture the immediate, intermediate and long-term relationships (0--4,
4--11, 11--20 and 20+).

First, models with a linear diabetes duration specification are presented
in table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-duration-linear}. The results
indicate a reduction of about 1.8 percentage points for men with each
additional year since diagnosis. For women the coefficient shows a
reduction of about one percentage point per year though the association
is not as strong. Interestingly, we find a reduction in female wages of about seven percentage points per year with diabetes but no effects for males and for the working hour models.

\end{table}  
  
  
  
Using the non-linear specification with splines, we find that for the pooled sample employment chances
are mainly reduced for those reporting a diagnosis more than eleven years
ago, with each additional year reducing employment chances by about
two percentage points (Table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-duration-splines-1}).
When stratified by gender, the
negative association persists for males and females, albeit much weaker for the latter. Interestingly, using splines
we find a relatively strong reduction of wages 5-11 years after diagnosis
for women. We also find some significant associations for those with more than 20 years of diabetes, however, these estimates are likely spurious due to the considerably reduced number of observations particularly for wages and working hours.

\caption{\label{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-duration-splines-1}\textbf{Relationship
of self-reported years since diagnosis and labour market outcomes
using linear splines (fixed effects)}}
\end{table}

Overall, the duration results are somewhat different to those found by \citet{Minor2013} for the \ac{USA}, who does not find evidence for a linear relationship of diabetes duration with employment chances. Our results from the non-linear analysis are not directly comparable as \citet{Minor2013} uses dummy variables to identify different diabetes durations. Nonetheless, they are similar in that he does not find an immediate effect of a diabetes diagnosis on employment chances. However, the effects still appear at an earlier point than in our analysis and are in general much larger. However, apart from not using splines he does not use individual fixed effects so that his results might suffer from bias leading to the larger effect sizes or the effects of diabetes in the \ac{USA} are simply much larger.
 
As a robustness check and due to the reduced number of observations for twenty or more years with diabetes we estimated the linear model again excluding those above nineteen years of diabetes to investigate if the effects were driven by these rare observations. These results are available on request and indicate marginally smaller effect sizes, but do not change the qualitative interpretation of the effects.

Generally, the results so far have revealed an important adverse association of self-reported diabetes with employment chances for men and also has provided additional evidence of adverse effects for females, supporting earlier findings for Mexico. We only find very limited evidence for any relationship of self reported diabetes with wages or working hours which is in line with the results of \citet{Minor2013}, who does not find strong evidence for any effects beyond those on employment, though he does not look at working hours. Reasons for this difference in effects at the extensive and intensive margin might be that people who are diagnosed while employed are able to continue to work if they do not suffer from any severe complications yet. They also may resort to doing different activities within the workplace that are less physically demanding and allow them to continue working and earning similar wages as before their diagnosis. Only once complications become increasingly severe they drop out of the labour market without going through a previous phase of reduced productivity and labour supply. Some support for this reasoning comes from the \ac{RE} results in tables \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-and} and \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-interaction} that show that people with diabetes still employed actually earn more if we disregard any unobserved selection into employment, i.e those with diabetes that are able to remain employed have some unobserved characteristics that also allow them to earn higher wages. These people might have abilities that make them better at managing their diabetes and also lets them earn higher wages or they may be so valuable to their working environment that they do not lose their job even if they are limited healthwise due to diabetes. This appears to be particularly the case for those in non-agricultural employment. Overall, it appears that diabetes affects those self-employed or in agricultural employment much more, potentially because they often cannot rely on formal contracts that would protect them against job loss, they are likely less able to access appropriate treatment or are diagnosed much later also due to a lack of access to proper health care leading to a more rapid development of diabetes complications and also because their jobs are likely more physically demanding, making it harder to continue working once complications appear. However, this reasoning remains speculative and deserves further research in future studies.

Finally, before moving on to further analyses, we want to note that our fixed effects strategy used to identify the effect of self-reported diabetes relies on those reporting a new diabetes diagnosis between any of the waves, which disregards people that have had diabetes before the start of the survey and so limits the estimation of effects to those more or less recently diagnosed. Accordingly, the obtained results may be different from those with a longer disease history. However, at least the results of the \ac{RE} analysis, which also includes between person variation, do not indicate that the effects are substantially different even when people with a longer disease history are taken into account. We have to note nonetheless that the analysis of diabetes duration shows somewhat different results with regards to when the adverse effects appear, as it indicates that the largest effects are found for those with a disease duration over 10 years which would suggest no immediate effect of diabetes. However, and as we have mentioned before, the duration analysis relies on information only from the most recent wave to construct a measure of disease duration for all previous waves and hence excludes information from participants dropping out of the sample before the last wave. It further relies on people correctly identifying the year of first diagnosis which is likely subject to recall bias the longer the diagnosis lies in the past, so that the results might not be directly comparable and generally less reliable than the estimates using self-reported diabetes from all three waves. Also, given that the signs point toward a negative effect also immediately after diagnosis (which is also supported by the \ac{RE} results), but standard errors are to large to suggest statistical significance could be a result of a lack of statistical power to identify a relationship for the other duration groups in the analysis using splines. Accordingly, further research in this area is needed to better understand when adverse effects appear. [NOT SURE IF THIS PARA SHOULD BE INCLUDED AS IT PARTICULALRY QUESTIONS THE RESULTS OF THE DURATION ANALYSIS. WHAT DO YOU THINK?]
  

\subsection{Cross-sectional biomarker analysis}

The results presented in the previous section did provide important
information on the association between self-reported diabetes and
with labour market outcomes in Mexico.

While panel data methods have obvious advantages over a cross sectional
analysis, there are additional insights
to be gained from making use of the biomarker data collected in the
third wave of the \ac{MxFLS}, even if it only allows for a cross-sectional
analysis. The biomarker data allows us to identify respondents with
\ac{HbA1c} levels, thereby identifying diabetes cases that have
not yet been 'officially' diagnosed. As mentioned before, biomarker
data are only available for a subsample of the survey, including everybody
aged 45+ as well as a random selection of participants below age 45
\citep{Crimmins2015}. In this sub-sample 694 (10 percent) self-report
diabetes and 1,248 (18 percent) have undiagnosed diabetes, i.e. as
measured by an \ac{HbA1c} equal to or greater than 6.5 percent. In an effort to reduce bias in our estimates we additionally estimate every model using community fixed effects to account for unobserved community characteristics such as the access to healthcare and the quality of healthcare in the community, poverty and unemployment levels in the community or the amount of public green space and recreational possibilities available. These factors could potentially affect the propensity to develop diabetes as well as to receive a diagnosis of diabetes and might also affect labour market outcomes.  \footnote{We did not use household fixed effects as the number of observations per household was close to one significantly limiting the variation within households needed for identification.}


\subsubsection*{Ojectively measured diabetes}


The results of the complete biomarker analysis are presented in table \ref{tab:Biomarker_results}. In order to have a comparison for the results using objectively measured
diabetes, we first present the estimates of a model using only self-reported diabetes as our diabetes measure. The estimates from the pooled sample and females
are in line with those from the panel data analysis, indicating a reduction
of between four to six percentage points in employment chances and no significant associations
for wages and working hours. In contrast to our panel data results,
we find only relatively week evidence for an association between self-reported diabetes and male
employment chances.

In the next step we investigate the association between objectively measured
diabetes,irrespective of whether
the condition has or has not been diagnosed, and labour market outcomes by estimating equation \ref{eq:diab_objective}. \footnote{The diabetes indicator
variable still also contains those that self-reported a diabetes diagnosis
but had \ac{HbA1c} levels below the diabetes threshold. This is sensible as it is possible that people with a diabetes diagnosis are able to manage their diabetes in such a way that their \ac{HbA1c} drop below the threshold and should not be assumed to having falsely reported a diabetes diagnosis, albeit this admittedly is a possibility as well. Robustness checks where we specifically accounted for this subpopulation
did not show qualitatively different results.}  We find an adverse association of objectively measured diabetes and employment
chances for the pooled and the female sample, but the coefficient size is reduced compared to self-reported diabetes. This suggests that relying on self-reported
diabetes exclusively may lead to an upward bias due to those undiagnosed experiencing less pronounced labour market effects.
To further investigate this, we include both diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes jointly as independent explanatory variables to account for the differences between the two groups as in equation \ref{eq:diab_sr_ud}.

As shown in columns 7--9 and 16--18 in table \ref{tab:Biomarker_results}, no association between undiagnosed
diabetes and any labour outcome is found. For those with diagnosed
diabetes the coefficients for the association with employment chances
 for the pooled sample and women are similar in size and significance to those of the panel analysis, particularly when we include community level fixed effects. They also do not differ much from the results of the specification only accounting for self-reported diabetes. Consistent with our earlier findings there is no indication of any associations between any form of diabetes and wages or working hours.

Overall, the finding that undiagnosed diabetes appears to not be associated with any adverse labour outcomes suggests that the two populations with diabetes, those with diagnosed and those with undiagnosed diabetes, are different in terms that are not yet captured by the used control variables. One possible factor that may explain these different outcomes is the psychological effect of a diabetes diagnosis leading to a reduction in employment chances due to justification bias or by causing depression or anxiety. Further, people with a diabetes diagnosis could be generally less healthy and have more diabetes related complications or other diseases that affect their employment chances. To get a better idea of the driving factors behind the results we included a measure of self-reported health as one of our regressors, despite the fact that it is clearly endogenous due to its relationship with diabetes which likely leads to worse self-reported health itself. Nonetheless, including it should account for the differences in health between those aware of their diabetes and those undiagnosed and subsequent changes in the diabetes coefficients may indicate if the differences in health might be driving the more adverse employment effects of self-reported diabetes. Indeed, the coefficients of self-reported diabetes are reduced in size and no longer significant for males and only borderline significant for females. In the pooled model, however, the coefficient remains highly significant. Interestingly, particularly for males reporting bad health is associated with a reduction in employment chances while this is not the case for females, suggesting that diagnosed males might actually be in a worse health state that is driving the reduction in employment chances while for women other factors could play a more important role. Accounting for measures of overweight and obesity, self-reported hypertension, self-reported heart disease and insurance status does not further affect the diabetes coefficient and significance to an important degree (results not shown here).

\subsubsection{HbA1c levels and labour market outcomes}

The \ac{HbA1c} information in wave 3 also enables us to use them as a proxy for disease
severity and diabetes management. Using three dummy variables for \ac{HbA1c} groups above the
diabetes threshold, i.e. 6.5--7.9, 8--11.9 and 12--14, we investigate
how labour market effects differ when taking \ac{HbA1c} values
into account. For employment chances
we again only find significant adverse associations for
those with diagnosed diabetes, particularly for \ac{HbA1c} levels of 6.5 \% to 7.9\%
and 8\% to 11.9\% compared to people without diabetes and an \ac{HbA1c} below the
diabetes threshold. Given that neither the coefficient size nor significance increases but rather levels off with higher blood glucose levels, we conclude that current diabetes management or severity of diabetes as indicated by \ac{HbA1c} levels is unrelated to the current employment status or any labour market outcome.

population in a broadly comparable way to this paper, though it stops short of investigating
the labour market impact of undiagnosed diabetes. The study indicates
an increasing negative relationship of diabetes and employment
chances and wages for men as \ac{HbA1c} levels increased, interacting \ac{HbA1c} levels
with the diabetes dummy. We estimate a similar model but
do not find any indication that increasing \ac{HbA1c} levels were
related with employment chances (results available on request). We
find the same to be true when using indicator variables for different
\ac{HbA1c} groups above the diabetes threshold, where the main effects
are found for those with relatively well managed diabetes and no
effects for those with the highest \ac{HbA1c} levels. While we cannot explain theses differences in the results between our study and the study of \citet{BrownIII2011} other than by acknowledging the fact that our studies is placed in a different country and uses a different age group, other results of their study also showed in line with our findings that once people are diagnosed with diabetes current diabetes management plays a minor role in determining labour market outcomes. This is not surprising given that \ac{HbA1c} levels only provide a picture of blood glucose levels over the last three month, which may not be very representative of blood glucose levels in the years before and after the diabetes diagnosis and that ultimately determine how soon complications appear and how severe they are.



\section{\label{sec:Conclusion}Conclusion}

According to the relatively novel panel data used here, self-reported diabetes has increased in Mexico between 2002 and 2011, and overall
diabetes prevalence has reached worrying
levels, in particular when including the strikingly large share of the undiagnosed diabetes population that we are able to investigate in this analysis. Given the rising importance of diabetes in Mexico and other \ac{MICs} knowledge about the economic costs it entails has also become highly needed and we tend to this need by providing important additional evidence on the relatively less studied labour market effects of diabetes taking into account several complexities that arise due the nature of the disease.

Our first important finding is the confirmation of a considerable employment burden for men and women reporting a diabetes diagnosis, even after accounting for an important source of potential unobserved heterogeneity by using individual \ac{FE} for the first time in the investigation of diabetes labour market effects, a potentially more valid strategy than relying on at least questionable \ac{IV} strategies used so far. This strategy also allowed us to account for any sample selection into employment based on time-invariant heterogeneity such as innate ability and we find that diabetes very likely is not related to a decrease in wages or working hours, suggesting that people who receive a diabetes diagnosed often drop out of the labour market once debilitating diabetes related complications appear and limit their work performance, in particular in jobs where formal job protection and good access to healthcare may be less available and that are also relatively more strenuous. However, those who remain employed do not suffer any wage or labour supply effects possibly  because they are still relatively healthy or work at a job or are able to resort to a type of work were their diabetes does not inhibit their performance. Future research will be needed to confirm and further investigate this finding.

Using the same strategy we also investigate the effect of diabetes duration on labour market outcomes and find that diabetes likely has a continuous adverse relationship with employment chances which might become increasingly stronger after the first ten years since diagnosis. This is not surprising given that many complications of diabetes only appear after some time living with the disease. This is likely bad news for many countries were diabetes, and in particular \ac{T2DM} start appearing at earlier ages in recent years, causing people to live with the disease for larger parts of their productive lifespan likely exacerbating the economic effects of unemployment due to diabetes. 

The other main contribution of this paper is the ability to identify previously unobserved people with diabetes via the use of biomarker data and the finding that undiagnosed
diabetes is not associated with labour market outcomes in Mexico. We still mostly find a negative association of diabetes with labour market outcomes but this association is significantly reduced. While this is only a cross-sectional analysis and the results can only be seen as associations, this is still an indication that studies relying solely on self-reported diabetes may not under- but overestimate the effect of diabetes on labour market outcomes due to non-classical reporting error. A similar finding was made by \citet{Cawley2015} regarding reporting error in weight. Therefore, it is important to see the population of people with diabetes consisting of those with self-reported diabetes and those with undiagnosed diabetes where the former differs from the latter in the amount of health information it possess and likely also its health status. The best way then to analyse the effects of diabetes should be to explicitly account for both groups if possible as using an \ac{IV} strategy will not correct for non-classical measurement error \citep{Cawley2015}.

To reiterate, the study finds a considerable negative impact of self-reported diabetes on labour market outcomes, a finding that is likely also of relevance to other \ac{MICs} facing similar diabetes problems. Further, when estimating any effects of diabetes using self-reported measures, any conclusions drawn should be limited to the those already diagnosed as otherwise any effects are likely to be overstated due to the often large population with undiagnosed diabetes.
