The theoretical framework of our study is based on the work of \citet{Strauss1998}. We are interested in the relationship between diabetes and labour market outcomes. To conceptualize this relationship we specify the following model of wages conditional on health.
\begin{equation}
w=w(H;S,A,B,I,\alpha,e_{w})\label{eq:wage}
\end{equation}
where $w$ is the real wage; $H$ is an array of measured health human capital; $S$ is education; $A$ is a vector of demographic characteristics; $B$ is the family background of the individual; $I$ is local community infrastructure; $\alpha$ is an array of unobservables such as ability and $e_w$ is measurement error. 

There are several ways diabetes may affect $H$. First of all, diabetes can deteriorate health if it remains untreated with the adverse effects increasing over time. Second, a diagnosis of diabetes and ensuing treatment may lead to better health after compared to the undiagnosed state, however, compared to healthy people even those with diabetes receiving treatment may still have worse health outcomes. Third, there is also evidence that a diagnosis may affect the own health perception and lead to worse self-reported health. We therefore expect diabetes to adversely affect health and consequently labour market outcomes.

However, estimating equation  \ref{eq:wage}, unobserved heterogeneity can bias the results. As mentioned in section  \ref{sec:Introduction} unobserved factors such as early childhood investments, innate ability and time preference could affect productivity at work as well as the probability to develop diabetes. Further, reverse causality might arise if wages or employment status affect the probability to develop diabetes via changes in lifestyle causing less healthy diet and physical activity patterns.

In the following section we will show how we will deal with these issues in our estimation strategy.
