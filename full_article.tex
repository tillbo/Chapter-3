\begin{abstract}
There remain gaps in the understanding of the economic consequences of diabetes, in particular in a context where diabetes often remains undiagnosed, as appears to be particularly the case in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We investigate the impact of diabetes on labor outcomes in Mexico using panel and biomarker data applying fixed effects estimation to account for potential endogeneity and using biomarker information to include previously undiagnosed diabetes. We find strong evidence for adverse effects of self-reported diabetes on the probability of being employed, in particular in agricultural work, but not on wages or hours worked. The employment probability falls gradually with time since diagnosis. In the biomarker analysis we observe that 18\% of all observations are false negatives (undiagnosed), i.e. do not report diabetes but exhibit glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels above the clinical diabetes threshold. The estimated employment impact for those that were found to exceed the clinical threshold suggests no effects for men but similar effects for women compared to self-reported diabetes. Further analysis reveals that there is no effect of diabetes on labor outcomes for undiagnosed women or men. The results highlight both the importance of the economic impact of diabetes, and the need to take into account undiagnosed patients.

\section{\label{sec:Introduction4}Introduction }

Diabetes, a disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels due to the body's inability to use insulin properly, has become a problem for both middle-income countries and high-income countries, with over two-thirds of people with diabetes living in the developing world \parencite{InternationalDiabetesFederation2015}. Mexicans and Mexican-Americans appear to be particularly affected by diabetes, also in comparison to other Latino populations \parencite{Schneiderman2014}. In Mexico, diabetes prevalence has grown from 6.7\% in 1994 to 14.4\% in 2006 \parencite{Barquera2013} and a 15.8\% prevalence rate in 2015 and diabetes has become the number one reason for death \parencite{InternationalDiabetesFederation2015}. The biggest danger of diabetes is the increase in risk for heart disease and stroke, blindness, kidney disease and nerve problems, food ulcers and amputations due to elevated glucose levels \parencite{Reynoso-Noveron2011}. However, via effective self-management of the disease much if not all of the complications can be avoided \parencite{Lim2011, Gregg2012}.

The observed trend has been attributed to a deterioration in diet and a reduction in physical activity \parencite{Barquera2008b,Basu2013}, while genetic predisposition among Mexicans with pre-Hispanic ancestry may also play a role \parencite{Williams2013}. Recent evidence indicates that the onset of diabetes has been occurring at an ever earlier age in Mexico \parencite{Bello-Chavolla2017a}, which given that only a minority of patients achieves adequate blood glucose control \parencite{Barquera2013}, will likely lead to an increase in complications during the productive lifespan. Further, the high diabetes burden in Mexico coexist with high levels of infectious diseases, exposing the health system to a 'double-disease burden' that increases the pressure to identify treatment priorities and to efficiently use the existing resources.

The effect of diabetes on labor outcomes has been studied predominantly in high-income countries, where diabetes was associated with reductions in employment probabilities as well as wages and labor supply \parencite{Brown2005,Brown2014,BrownIII2011,Minor2011,Minor2013,Minor2015,Latif2009,Seuring2015a}.\footnote{We know of only two studies for middle-income countries, one for Mexico \parencite{Seuring2015} and one for China \parencite{Liu2014}, which are discussed later in greater detail.} While these studies have provided useful evidence, many of the complexities of the relationship between diabetes and labor outcomes remain unaddressed. 

Time-invariant unobserved individual characteristics (e.g. health endowments or risk preferences) may adversely affect health in general and the propensity to develop type 2 diabetes in particular \parencite{VanEwijk2011,Sotomayor2013,Li2010b}; they may also affect employment probabilities, wages or working hours---either directly through their effects on contemporaneous productivity \parencite{Currie2013}, or indirectly by limiting educational attainment and human capital accumulation \parencite{Ayyagari2011a}. Further, given the chronic nature of the condition, a better understanding of the time and severity of the potential labor market penalties is important. 

Another, mostly overlooked, challenge are the high rates of undiagnosed diabetes in \acp{LMIC} \parencite{Beagley2014},  and studies relying on self-reported diabetes data may have left undetected important differences between those with diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes. For instance, a diabetes diagnosis in itself may exert an effect independently of that resulting from the actual disease \parencite{Liu2014}. Stress, depression, anxiety and the demands of disease management resulting from the diagnosis of diabetes may lead to productivity reductions, and may also be used as a justification to reduce labor supply \parencite{Kapteyn2009}. Further, people with undiagnosed diabetes may be in better health than those diagnosed if a diagnosis is related to the development of diabetes complications. Therefore, labor market effects might well be distinct for people with self-reported diabetes versus those unaware of their condition.

The objective of this study is to provide new evidence on the impact of diabetes on labor outcomes, critically improving upon previous work by paying close attention to the challenges of unobserved heterogeneity, to the chronic nature of diabetes and to those undiagnosed. We use three waves of panel data from the \acf{MxFLS}, covering the period 2002--2012. Applying individual level \acf{FE} for the first time in this literature, we take account of time-invariant heterogeneity when assessing the impact of self-reported diabetes and the time since diagnosis on labor outcomes.\footnote{A recent review of the economic cost of diabetes confirms the scarcity of evidence for low- and middle-income countries \parencite{Seuring2015a}.} We also make use of rich and novel biomarker data from the most recent wave of the \ac{MxFLS}, to explore the role of undiagnosed diabetes.

Our results of the panel data analysis for self-reported diabetes suggest an economically important decrease in the employment probability. Wages and working hours, however, remain unaffected. Further analysis for the long term indicates that employment probabilities are reduced immediately after diagnosis and then further after the first 10 years.

The biomarker analysis reveals that clinically diagnosed diabetes entails a significant employment penalty for women but not for men. Jointly assessing the effects of both clinical and self-reported diabetes provides an insight into the labor market impact for those with undiagnosed diabetes---people who are tested positive but did not self-report: in contrast to those self-reporting diabetes, men and women unaware of their condition do not experience adverse labor market effects.	 


\section{\label{sec:labor  outcomes and diabetes literature}Diabetes and labor outcomes---what do we know?}

A very limited number of studies provide insights on the relationship between diabetes and labor outcomes in \acp{LMIC}. \textcite{Liu2014} exploit a natural experiment in China and find a significant reduction in income for those with a recent diagnosis of diabetes. A study for Mexico using cross-sectional data from 2005, finds a significant (p<0.01) reduction in employment probabilities for males by about 10 percentage points and for females by about 4.5 percentage points (p<0.1). The latter study used parental diabetes as an \ac{IV} to deal with the potential endogeneity of diabetes \parencite{Seuring2015}.

More studies have investigated the effects of diabetes on labor outcomes in high-income countries. \textcite{Brown2005} consider an elderly population of Mexican-Americans living close to the Mexican border in the US, and find 7 percentage points lower employment rates for men with self-reported diabetes, while for women, the negative relationship becomes insignificant when using \ac{IV} estimation.  In a similar vein, \textcite{BrownIII2011}, again considering a cross-section of Mexican-Americans, detect a negative  relationship between the level of \ac{HbA1c} on one hand and the probability of employment or male wages on the other hand. Women remain again unaffected.  

Slightly different results are obtained in two other studies, this time for a more representative US population: using a sample comprised exclusively of women, \textcite{Minor2011} finds a significant negative effect of self-reported diabetes on female employment and earnings but not on working hours. In this study self-reported diabetes turns out as endogenous and the simple probit estimates are downward biased compared to \ac{IV} estimates. In a subsequent study by the same author on the effects of diabetes over time, employment probabilities decline shortly after diagnosis for men and after about 10 years for women, while wages are not affected by the time since diagnosis \parencite{Minor2013}.

Results for Canada indicate a significant negative impact of self-reported diabetes on the employment probability of women, but not of men, using an \ac{IV} strategy similar to \textcite{Brown2005}. The \ac{IV} results suggest diabetes to be  endogenous for men, resulting in upward biased probit estimates \parencite{Latif2009}. For Australia, \textcite{Zhang2009} show  reduced labor market participation for men and women as a result of diabetes, with the effects again appearing overstated in the 'naive' regression models.

To the best of our knowledge, only one labor market related study has considered undiagnosed diabetes, if for a small sample: \textcite{Minor2015} find no statistically significant relationship between undiagnosed diabetes and employment probabilities, but negative and statistically significant results when using self-reported diabetes, for both men and women. When merging both the undiagnosed and self-reporting respondents into one diabetes group, the effect on employment remains statistically significant but decreases in magnitude.\footnote{Table \ref{tab:rev_Diab_employment} in the appendix summarizes the main findings of these studies, the characteristics of the sample, the estimation method they use and the approach to measure diabetes.}

While these studies suggest substantial economic losses for individuals and households affected by diabetes, most of the existing evidence suffers from methodological limitations, in particular due to the use of cross-sectional data and the limited possibilities to account for unobserved characteristics. The papers attempting to address this bias rely on the family history of diabetes as the identifying instrument to exploit the genetic component of the disease. However, it remains debatable whether the instrument indeed satisfies the exclusion restriction, as it may also proxy for other genetically transferred traits, including unobserved abilities, as well as  intrahousehold or intergenerational dynamics that impact labor outcomes directly.\footnote{It is plausible that diabetes might deteriorate parental health in such a way that the offspring either has to decrease labor supply to provide care, or has to increase labor supply to compensate for lost income, as also argued by \textcite{Seuring2015}.} 

Furthermore, most studies use self-reported diabetes as a proxy for diabetes. Self-reported health data likely suffer from  several short-comings, thus introducing non-classical measurement error due to systematic misreporting. In the context of labor market impact studies, such measurement error has been shown to potentially cause biased and overstated impact estimates \parencite{Cawley2015,ONeill2013,Perks2015}. With regards to diabetes, the concern is especially linked to possible false negatives. False positives might be of far less concern since one would expect there to be limited incentive to falsely report a diabetes diagnosis---although this cannot be entirely excluded. This pattern is supported by the biomarker data in our study as well as by a recent study from China. The results for China show that people with self-report diabetes are highly likely to actually have diabetes (>98\%), while only a minority of those who have diabetes (40\%) according to clinical tests, actually self-report the disease \parencite{Yuan2015}. This pattern is confirmed in our data, where the biomarker results support 81\% of positive diabetes self-reports.\footnote{Even of those reporting a diabetes diagnosis while the biomarker data suggest non-diabetic \ac{HbA1c} levels, many likely have diabetes but treatment has pushed their \ac{HbA1c} levels back below the threshold, leading to very few false positives.}  However, a much larger proportion reports false negatives (18\% of sample), suggesting a large undiagnosed population with diabetes. This population may have a distinct profile that prevented them from getting diagnosed: for instance, they may not be able to afford health care, live further away from a health facility,  or their diabetes has remained mostly asymptomatic so far, all potentially influencing the effect of diabetes on their labor outcomes. This suggests that accounting for the undiagnosed population will lead to a better understanding of the economic impact of diabetes.



\section{\label{sec:Data}Data}

This paper uses the \acf{MxFLS}, a nationally representative longitudinal household survey containing three waves conducted in 2002, 2005--2006 and 2009--2012. All household members aged 15 and above were interviewed, covering information on a wide range of social, demographic, economic and health characteristics \parencite{Rubalcava2013}. Throughout the analysis, the samples used are restricted to the working age population (15--64). Our first part of the analysis uses all three waves and the panel structure of the data. The second part uses a biomarker subsample of the third wave (2009---2012). Because the biomarker sample includes everybody above the age of 44 but only a random subsample of those aged 44 or below \parencite{Crimmins2015}, its age structure is older and hence its self-reported diabetes prevalence is higher. This reduces direct comparability to the panel results and biomarker based results will be compared to the analysis of the self-reported data for this subsample specifically.

Our outcome variables of interest are employment status, hourly wage, weekly working hours and occupation.\footnote{Employment status is defined as having worked or having carried out an activity that helped with the household expenses the last week and working for at least four hours per week. We explicitly include those employed informally, for instance people working in a family business. We tested if changing the definition of being employed to having worked at least ten hours per week affects the results. This only leads to marginal changes, not affecting the interpretation of the results. Hourly wage was calculated by adding up reported monthly income from the first and second job (if any), dividing it by the average number of weeks per month, which was then divided by weekly working hours. Labor income was reported in two ways: either responding to questions on wages, income from piecework, tips, income from extra hours, meals, housing, transport, medical benefits and other earnings, or by reporting the aggregate labor income for the whole month. We adjusted the calculated wage for inflation from the year of the interview up to 2013 and took the log of real wages.  Due to a considerable number of missing or zero income reports, the sample used for the wage estimation is smaller than the sample for working hours. Working hours reflect working hours of the first and second job (if applicable).} Descriptive statistics for the entire panel sample show that 86\% of men report some form of employment compared to 37\% of women (see Table \ref{tab:Pooled-sample-characteristics}). Interestingly, men do not report considerably higher hourly wages than women but work more hours per week. Men also work more often in agricultural jobs while women are more likely to be self-employed or in non-agricultural wage employment. Women also have lower educational attainment on average.

The first part of the analysis focuses on the relationship of labor outcomes with self-reported diabetes\footnote{Self-reported diabetes is based on the survey question: “Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?”}. For the pooled data of all three waves (Table \ref{tab:Pooled-sample-characteristics}), diabetes was self-reported by 5\% of men and 6\% of women, respectively. This is consistent with \textcite{Barquera2013}, who observe a prevalence of diagnosed diabetes in Mexico of 7.5\% in 2006, using a slightly older sample that also included respondents beyond 64 years of age. Apart from self-reported diabetes information that is available in all rounds, we also use information on the self-reported year of diagnosis as well as biometrically measured \ac{HbA1c} levels for a subsample of respondents. Throughout, our analysis focuses on the working age population (15–64), and excludes pregnant women and those in school.\footnote{Pregnant women have an increased diabetes risk and this may bias the estimated impact of diabetes on female employment status. We dropped all observations of women reporting to be pregnant at the time of the survey (N=764). We also estimated models including a dummy variable for pregnant women. This only leads to minor changes in the diabetes coefficient for women and does not affect the interpretation of the results.}

\begin{center}
	\textbf{Table \ref{tab:Pooled-sample-characteristics} about here}
\end{center}

Because self-reported diabetes reporting exhibited some inconsistency over time for some of the respondents, we apply corrections using disease information from earlier and subsequent waves to infer on the current, missing or inconsistent, diabetes status. Appendix A provides details on the procedure. Information on the self-reported year of diagnosis allows us to construct a measure of the time since diagnosis for all waves. Importantly, this limits the sample of the time since diagnosis analysis to those that were present in the third wave. 

A further, and no less important, source of measurement error with self-reported diabetes is the omission of those with undiagnosed diabetes, i.e the false negatives. The information on biometrically measured blood glucose values for a subsample of the 2009-2012 wave, containing data for over 6000 respondents allows identification of respondents with undiagnosed diabetes. 

The biomarker data indicate that a large share of the sample (27\%) have an \ac{HbA1c} indicative of diabetes, defined by the \ac{WHO} as levels equal to or above 6.5\% \parencite{WorldHealthOrganization2011}. A second striking observation is the large proportion of false negatives, namely 18\% of all observations, implying that 68\% of males and females who test positive do not self-report and hence are unaware of their condition. This may lead to biased estimates based on self-reported diabetes.

\section{\label{sec:Estimation Strategy}Estimation strategy}

To investigate the relationship between self-reported diabetes and three labor outcomes: employment, wages and weekly working hours, respectively, we estimate the following \acf{FE} model.\footnote{We also estimated random effects models but do not present them here as the Hausman test suggested the use of the FE model throughout. Results are obtainable upon request.}


\begin{equation}
Y_{it}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Diabetes_{it}+\beta_{2}X_{it}+c_{i}+\gamma_{t}+u_{it}.\label{eq:cha4_employed}
\end{equation}


where $Y_{it}$ is a binary variable taking a value of $1$ if respondent $i$ reports being in employment at time $t$ and $0$ otherwise, $Diabetes_{it}$ is a binary variable taking a value of $1$ at time $t$ if the respondent reports having ever received a diagnosis of diabetes\footnote{The data at hand does not allow us to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Existing studies find no effect of type 1 diabetes on labor outcomes  \parencite{Minor2011,Minor2015}. Our estimates of type 2 diabetes impact on labor outcomes may therefore be attenuated and provide a lower bound.}, $X_{it}$ is a vector of control variables, $c_{i}$ represents an individual fixed effect, $\gamma_{t}$ represents year dummies, while $u_{it}$ is the error term.

For the relationship of diabetes with wages and working hours, our empirical models are estimated conditional on being in employment. $Y_{it}$ represents the log hourly wage or the weekly working hours over the last year, for respondent $i$ at time $t$.

We control in detail for levels of urbanization, with rural as the reference category, for state level effects, for marital status, the number of children residing in the household below the age of 6, a quadratic age term and calendar year dummies as well as for household wealth based on an indicator created using principal component analysis of multiple indicators of household assets and housing conditions \parencite{Filmer2001}\footnote{Our composite wealth index consists of owning a vehicle, a second house, a washing machine, dryer, stove, refrigerator or furniture, any electric appliances, any domestic appliances, a bicycle or farm animals. It further accounts for the physical condition of the house, proxied by the floor material of the house, and the type of water access.}. 

Importantly, while the \ac{FE} model controls for unobserved personal characteristics, omitted time-variant variables and simultaneity may still affect the relationship of interest. So could job loss lead to lifestyle choices that cause changes in the probability to develop diabetes, which could in turn affect labor outcomes. While we cannot exclude this possibility, existing work for high-income countries finds no evidence for this kind of reverse causality \parencite{Bergemann2011,Schaller2015}, suggesting that the \ac{FE} approach will help to considerably reduce any existing bias.


\subsection{\textit{Labor outcomes and time since diagnosis}}

In light of the chronic nature and irreversibility of diabetes, there is good reason to explore the long term effects post diagnosis.  We estimate the following model:

\begin{equation}
Y_{it}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Dyears_{it}+\beta_{2}X_{it}+c_{i}+u_{it},\label{eq:duration_linear}
\end{equation}

where $\beta_{1}Dyears_{it}$ is continuous indicating years since first reported diabetes diagnosis.\footnote{Note that while usually the simultaneous inclusion of year dummies and time since diagnosis, which varies by one unit in each time period, would not allow a separate identification of the coefficient of time since diabetes diagnosis in Eq. \ref{eq:duration_linear} and Eq.  \ref{eq:splines}, identification has to rely on the presence of people without diabetes in the sample, for which diabetes duration does not increase.  Models excluding the calendar year dummies provide similar results.  As a further robustness check, we also estimate two models that only use between-individuals variation, i.e. a \ac{LPM} that uses only data from the third wave, the only wave where year of diagnosis was originally reported, and a pooled \ac{LPM} that used data from all three waves.} To capture possible non-linearities in the relationship we also consider a spline function that allows for non-linear effects over time.

\begin{equation}
Y_{it}=\delta_{0}+g(Dyears_{it})+\delta_{2}X_{it}+c_{i}+u_{it}.\label{eq:splines}
\end{equation}

\noindent with $g(Dyears_{it})=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\delta_{n}\cdot max\{Dyears_{it}-\eta_{n-1}\}I_{in}$ and $I_{in}=1[\eta_{n-1}\leq Dyears_{it}<\eta_{n}]$, with $\eta_{n}$ being the place of the $n$-th node for $n=1,2,\ldots,N$. The coefficient $\delta_{n}$ captures the effect of diabetes for the $n$-th interval. The effects are linear if $\delta_{1}=\delta_{2}=,\ldots,=\delta_{n}$.\footnote{Because the year of diagnosis was only reported in the third wave, time since diagnosis is not available for those who were not interviewed in the third round.  A reported diagnosis in the year of the interview is counted as 'one year since diagnosis'.} Based on visual inspection (Figure \ref{fig:Kernel-weighted-local-polynomial_comb} on page \pageref{fig:Kernel-weighted-local-polynomial_comb}) we choose three nodes that seem to best account for possible non-linearities in the relationship between diabetes duration and labor outcomes best. These are located at 4, 11 and 20 years after diagnosis. The first four years capture any immediate effects of the diagnosis, the years five to eleven any effects during time of adaptation to the disease and the last term (beyond 11 years) accounts for the long-term effects.

\subsection{\label{sec:Biomarker Strategy}\textit{Labor outcomes and biometrically measured diabetes}}

Since a sizable number of individuals remain undiagnosed, and some may also misreport their diabetes status, estimations based on self-reports may be biased. The use of biomarker data from a subsample of the most recent wave allows us to explore both the extent of under- and overreporting, and the possible bias in the estimated relationship between diabetes and labor outcomes when relying on self-reported diabetes; it also enables us to look at diabetes severity, as measured by \ac{HbA1c} values. 

The analysis consists of three steps. We first re-estimate Eq. \ref{eq:diab_sr} to assess the relationship between self-reported diabetes with labor outcomes, but this time for the cross-sectional biomarker sample only, using the following specification:
\begin{equation}
Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Dsr_{i}+\beta_{2}X_{i}+c_{i}+v_{i}\label{eq:diab_sr}
\end{equation}

where $v_{i}$ are community fixed effects which reflect local unobserved characteristics such as access to healthcare, poverty and unemployment in the community.\footnote{We did not use household fixed effects since the average number of observations per household was close to one, as most households had only one member providing biomarker information.}

In a second step we then estimate the relations between diabetes (as defined by the \ac{HbA1c} biomarker) and labor outcomes, using the following equation:

\begin{equation}
Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Dbio^{d}_{i}+\beta_{2}X_{i}+v_{i}+u_{i}\label{eq:diab},
\end{equation}

where $Dbio^{d}$ is equal to $1$ if \ac{HbA1c} $\geq6.5\%$. 

To estimate the effect of undiagnosed diabetes, in Eq. \ref{eq:diab_ud} we add self-reported diabetes back in and interact it with the biomarker.

\begin{equation}
Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Dsr_{i}+\beta_{2}Dbio_{i}+\beta_{3}Dsr_{i}*Dbio_{i}+\beta_{4}X_{i}+v_{i}+u_{i}.\label{eq:diab_ud}
\end{equation}

The interaction term changes the interpretation of $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$, with $\beta_{1}$ now representing the effect of those aware of their condition but with \ac{HbA1c} levels below the diabetes threshold and $\beta_{2}$ those with undiagnosed diabetes, i.e. not self-reporting diabetes but with \ac{HbA1c} levels equal to or above the threshold. The interaction term $\beta_{3}$ shows the effect for those with self-reported diabetes and \ac{HbA1c} levels above the threshold. We then test if $\beta_{1} + \beta_{3} = \beta_{2}$, i.e. if self-reported diabetes is significantly different from undiagnosed diabetes.

We further investigate the effect of the severity of diabetes on labor outcomes, replacing $Dbio^{d}$ with $Dbio^{c}$ , a variable that is 0 for \ac{HbA1c} < 6.5\% and takes the actual value of \ac{HbA1c} for those with an $HbA1c \geq 6.5\%$ (Eq. \ref{eq:diab_hba1c}). This will allow us to investigate the effect of a one percentage point increase in \ac{HbA1c} levels for people with undiagnosed diabetes ($\beta_{2}$) as well as those with self-reported diabetes above the diabetes threshold ($\beta_{3}$).

\begin{equation}
Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Dsr_{i}+\beta_{2}Dbio^{c}_{i}+\beta_{3}Dsr_{i}*HbA1c_{i}+\beta_{4}X_{i}+v_{i}+u_{i}.\label{eq:diab_hba1c}
\end{equation}

\section{\label{sec:cha_4_results}Results}


\subsection{\textit{Labor outcomes and self-reported diabetes}}

The results of estimating Eq. \ref{eq:cha4_employed} shown in table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-and} indicate significant and substantial reductions in the probability of employment for men and women with self-reported diabetes. Employment probabilities are reduced by over 5 percentage points for both genders, translating into relative reductions of 14\% for women and of 6\% for men. No significant relationship between wages and working hours is found (Columns 3--6 of Table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-and}).

Because results for wages and working hours may differ by type of work due to differing physical demands, we interact diabetes with agricultural employment and self-employment, using non-agricultural wage employment as the comparison group. The results in table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-and} panel B do not suggest such an effect, however. While the interaction term for diabetes on work hours in agriculture indicates a reduction compared to non-agricultural employment, a Wald test does not indicate a significant difference to agricultural workers without diabetes  ($p = .15$).

\begin{center}
	\textbf{Table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-and} about here}
\end{center}

One possible explanation for the lack of effects at the internal margin is selection bias, with those with 'mild' or asymptomatic diabetes being more likely to maintain their productivity. Only once complications become increasingly severe would they switch activity (or drop out of the labor market), without going through a notable phase of reduced productivity and labor supply.

To assess whether diabetes affects the selection into different types of work, we estimate \ac{FE} models of the probability of being in non-agricultural wage employment, agricultural employment or self-employment, respectively. We only find evidence for negative effects on the probabilities of females to work in agriculture, possibly due to the higher physical requirements (table (\ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-selection_LPM}).\footnote{We prefer this model to a multinomial logit because it allows full control of fixed effects, and it produces results that are straightforward to interpret. As a robustness check we also estimated a multinomial logit model that includes means of time-varying covariates to proxy for fixed effects (see \textcite{Mundlak1978,Bell2015}). The results turn out very similar, both in size and statistical significance.}

\end{center}

\subsection{\label{sec:duration}\textit{Labor outcomes and time since diagnosis}}

Given the chronic nature of diabetes, we investigate how soon after the first diagnosis it impacts labor outcomes. Using non-parametric kernel-weighted local polynomial regression, Figure \ref{fig:Kernel-weighted-local-polynomial_comb} shows that the probability of employment for men more or less steadily declines as time progresses. For women, a first drop-off occurs right after diagnosis; thereafter no consistent pattern is observed.\footnote{Since long run estimations suffer from large standard errors---as the sample size is strongly reduced---this limits its interpretation and we therefore truncate the graphs at a disease duration of 24 years.} For wages and working hours somewhat less clear dynamics are observed, with a possibly long term negative trend for women but not for men.

\begin{center}
	\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:Kernel-weighted-local-polynomial_comb} about here}
\end{center}


Table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-duration_employ} panel A shows the results of estimating Eq. \ref{eq:duration_linear}, which indicate that male employment probabilities fall every year, with the biggest effects being observed in the \ac{FE} model. For women, the coefficient shows a reduction of close to 1 percentage point per year in the \ac{FE} model, though its statistical significance is lower than in the \ac{OLS} models. 



\begin{center}
	\textbf{Table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-duration_employ} about here}
\end{center}


Panel B shows the estimates when using a spline function as described in Eq. \ref{eq:splines}. The coefficients provide some evidence for an immediate effect of diabetes on men employment probabilities, which then levels off for some time upon which it becomes stronger again.

Female wages are reduced by about 7\% per year after diagnosis in the linear \ac{FE} model, while no effect is found for men. The non-linear results suggest that wages are reduced 5--11 years after the initial diagnosis for both men and women, and potentially after more than 20 years for women only.\footnote{The results for over 20 years may be spurious as they suffer from a low number of observations There are only 9 (3) observations for male (female) wages with more than 20 years since diagnosis in wave 3, and 17 (7) in the pooled sample. For male (female) working hours there are 12 (7) observations with more than 20 years since diagnosis in wave 3, and 20 (12) for the pooled sample.} Interestingly, these reductions in wages appear exactly at points where employment probabilities are less affected. This may suggest reductions in productivity being compensated by lower wages rather than job loss. There is no consistent relationship of time since diagnosis with working hours.

\subsection{\textit{Cross-sectional biomarker analysis}}


Table \ref{tab:Biomarker_observations} presents a cross tabulation of self-reported diabetes and biomarker results. Overall, for 80\% of the observations the self-reports are consistent with the biomarker results (diagonal cell \%), 18\% are false negatives or undiagnosed and 2\% false positives, though the latter may include cases that received a diabetes diagnosis and have managed to reduce their \ac{HbA1c} levels to non-diabetes levels via medication and/or lifestyle changes \parencite{Flores-Hernandez2015}.  There are no considerable differences between men and women (results not shown). 

\begin{center}
	\textbf{Table \ref{tab:Biomarker_observations} about here}
\end{center}


Table \ref{tab:Biomarker_results} presents the results from estimating Eq. \ref{eq:diab_sr}, Eq. \ref{eq:diab}, Eq. \ref{eq:diab_ud} and Eq. \ref{eq:diab_hba1c}. Panel A of Table \ref{tab:Biomarker_results} shows that the earlier longitudinal results using self-reported diabetes carry over to the cross-sectional biomarker sample. The coefficients in panel B indicate that the relationship with employment becomes much weaker when using diabetes defined by the biomarker instead of self-reported diabetes, in particular for men. Results in Panel C are obtained from estimating Eq. \ref{eq:diab_ud}, where we interact self-reported diabetes with biometrically measured diabetes, which allows us to identify the effect of undiagnosed diabetes. 

There does not appear to be a statistically significant negative relationship between undiagnosed diabetes (expressed in the 'Biomarker diabetes but not self-reported' coefficient) with any labor outcome. The coefficients for the interaction term are negative throughout, though only statistically significant for male wages and female working hours. To establish if the effects of self-reported diabetes ($\beta_{1} + \beta{3}$) and undiagnosed diabetes ($\beta_{2}$) are significantly different, an F-test is conducted. Overall, we find little evidence of a statistically significant difference, apart from female working hours and potentially male employment probabilities.

\begin{center}
	\textbf{Table \ref{tab:Biomarker_results} about here}
\end{center}


To explore whether the adverse effects increase with higher  \ac{HbA1c} levels we estimate the model detailed in Eq. \ref{eq:diab_hba1c}. The results in panel D support the findings from panel C, showing negative coefficients for a 1 percentage point increase in \ac{HbA1c} for those with self-reported diabetes and \ac{HbA1c} levels in the diabetes range, again, however, only statistically significant for male wages and female working hours. For undiagnosed diabetes, again no effects are found.

To further investigate the smaller impact of undiagnosed diabetes, we examine potential mediators. People self-reporting diabetes may have a different profile in terms of diabetes complications or self-reported health compared to those undiagnosed. First, we therefore include a range of indicators for other chronic diseases that are often related to diabetes. More specifically, we control for being overweight or obese (based on anthropometric measures of \ac{BMI}) and self-reported hypertension and heart disease. If those diagnosed with diabetes are more likely to experience adverse labor outcomes because they are more likely to suffer from one of these conditions, then accounting for them should lead to a reduction in the coefficient of self-reported diabetes. Panel A of table \ref{tab:Diagnosed_undiagnosed_condensed}, however, indicates only small reductions in the coefficients of self-reported diabetes ($\beta_{1}+\beta_{3}$), suggesting no major contributions of these factors to the economic burden of diabetes. 

\begin{center}
	\textbf{Table \ref{tab:Diagnosed_undiagnosed_condensed} about here}
\end{center}

Controlling for subjective health instead of chronic diseases, the results reported in Table \ref{tab:Diagnosed_undiagnosed_condensed}, panel B, show a somewhat bigger change in coefficients. The overall effect of self-reported diabetes on the probability of male employment is now comparatively smaller and becomes statistically insignificant. The effect for male undiagnosed diabetes remains close to zero. For women, the coefficient for self-reported diabetes is also reduced, while the effect for undiagnosed diabetes remains the same. We do not observe major changes for all other outcomes.   






\section{\label{sec:cha_4_conclusion}Discussion}

Diabetes is now one of the most common chronic diseases in middle- and high-income countries, with the potential to severely impact the health and economic well-being of those affected. Yet rigorous evidence on the economic consequences for these countries
remains scarce. 

To address key methodological challenges, this paper uses rich longitudinal panel data from Mexico that also contain diabetes biomarker. The biomarker data confirm the alarming levels of clinically tested diabetes (27\% prevalence) and indicate that a large proportion of these (18\% of the population) are unaware of their condition.

The paper finds evidence for adverse effects of self-reported diabetes on the probability of being employed, but not on wages or hours worked, using fixed effects estimation. Considering different types of work, the relationship between self-reported diabetes, wages
and hours worked remains weak, but the results also suggest occupational selection with women with self-reported diabetes less likely to work in agriculture. These results confirm earlier findings for Mexico regarding the employment impact of diabetes that used cross-sectional information, however, they also suggest a comparatively larger impact of diabetes on female employment probabilities. For wages and working hours they present first evidence.

Analysis of the long term impact suggests that the employment probability falls gradually over the years after having been diagnosed with this chronic condition. Overall, in particular female employment chances and potentially also female wages are reduced. This contrasts with estimates for the USA \parencite{Minor2013}, where only a non-linear relationship has been observed, indicating reductions in employment probabilities for females after 11 to 15 years and after 2-5 years for males.\footnote{Note that our non-linear results are not directly comparable to Minor's as he used pooled cross-sectional data, made use of dummy variables to indicate time since diagnosis and used different categories of duration. Following the approach of \textcite{Minor2013}, we find a significant reduction in employment probabilities throughout, regardless of whether we use our duration groups to construct the dummies or the duration groups used by \textcite{Minor2013}.} 

Making use of the biomarker data allows us to both test reporting error (false negatives) and the effects of undiagnosed diabetes. We find that diabetes based on biomarkers is less related to reduced employment compared to self-reported diabetes, in particular for men. Further analysis shows that this is due to the non-existing relationship of undiagnosed diabetes with employment. For the USA, \textcite{Minor2015} find, similar to us, no statistically significant effects of undiagnosed diabetes on employment, while the effect of diagnosed diabetes is significant. Our results further suggest, that the reason for the difference between diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes are not mediated by current \ac{HbA1c} levels, but rather overall health status. This is supported by findings for Mexican-Americans in the USA, where no changes in labor outcomes were found with increasing \ac{HbA1c} levels \parencite{BrownIII2011}. This may not be surprising given that \ac{HbA1c} levels are only informative for the last three months, and are not the only indicator for the severity of diabetes. They may further be affected by treatment, so that people with already severe diabetes complications and a long diabetes duration may have lower \ac{HbA1c} levels due to their medical treatment and experience with managing the disease.

Our findings bear several implications. First, the impact of self-reported diabetes on labor outcomes in Mexico is mostly limited to its effect on employment probabilities, though there is some indication that it could also reduce wages over time. Second, its effect on employment is much stronger for females. The reasons for this remain unclear but it could be due to lower wages or working hours for women, making a drop out less costly, or lower formal employment rates, making it easier to discriminate against people with diabetes. Other evidence suggests, that diabetes in women may be more severe due to women being in worse metabolic health compared to men when they cross the diabetes threshold. Third, when interpreting labor market impact estimates relying on self-reported diabetes, one cannot assume that the results extend to those with undiagnosed diabetes. Studies should therefore, when possible, account for both groups separately, acknowledging their inherent differences, to gain information about the distribution of the economic burden across the two groups.

Our results add further weight to the case for reducing the incidence and progression of diabetes. The large proportion of previously undiagnosed cases indicates that diagnosis---at least in Mexico---still happens too late or not at all. This reduces the possibilities to prevent complications via treatment and self-management, thereby increasing the risk of severe complications appearing earlier. Hence, much of the health and economic burden may be prevented by earlier diagnosis and ensuing effective treatment of those already diagnosed with diabetes. Further, there is a particular need to explore why women experience such strong economic effects. Ultimately, there is a need to invest in the prevention of diabetes. Taxation of sugar sweetened beverages may be one promising way forward \parencite{Colchero2016}, though the long-term effects remain to be demonstrated. Further, considering the double-disease burden of non-communicable and communicable diseases in many \ac{LMICs}, investments in maternal and child health may not only reduce the current disease burden but also the future incidence of diabetes, given the established links between early life heath and later life incidence of diabetes and other chronic diseases \parencite{Sotomayor2013,Hanson2012,Li2010b}.

\section{\label{sec:Appendix}Strategies to deal with inconsistent self-reporting over time}

Reporting error can pose a considerable challenge in the use of self-reported data. Fortunately, the \ac{MxFLS} data provide several possibilities to assess the amount of misreporting and apply corrections before estimating the labor market effects of diabetes. In what follows we describe how we have dealt with inconsistencies in self-reported diabetes over time.

Throughout the surveys, self-reported diabetes was measured by the question 'Have you ever been diagnosed by diabetes'. If they answered 'yes', they were asked if they received treatment for diabetes and the type of treatment they received.

One of the key advantages of panel data is the repeated measurement which results in more than one data point allowing to uncover inconsistencies for cases with multiple observations. Very little is known about inconsistencies in self-reported diabetes over time. However, \textcite{Zajacova2010} assess the consistency of a self-reported cancer diagnosis over time in the USA. The study found that 30\% of those who had reported a cancer diagnosis at an earlier point failed to report the diagnosis at a later point in time. A more recent diagnosis was found to be reported with greater consistency possibly due to increasing recall problems as time since diagnosis advanced.

When assessing the \ac{MxFLS}, we also found inconsistencies in the diabetes self-reports across the three waves, with between 10--20\% of those reporting diabetes in one wave not doing so in one of the subsequent waves. To improve the validity of diabetes self-reports, we were interested in reducing the amount of reporting inconsistencies.

As discussed at the end of section \ref{sec:Data}, for diabetes, the main concern with mismeasurement is related to false negatives. False positives are deemed less of a problem since incentives to report diabetes when one does not have it seem to be very limited---although we cannot exclude this.  A study from China finds that the vast majority (98\%) of those who self-report diabetes are tested positive for diabetes, while only a minority  of those who are tested positive for diabetes (40\%) actually self-report the disease \parencite{Yuan2015}.  Our data showed a similar pattern, with a negligible proportion (3\%) of the respondents who are tested negative self-reporting to suffer from diabetes, while the majority of those who are tested positive (68\%) do not self-report suffering from diabetes.

We used the above information to infer the "true" diabetes status for those with inconsistent reports. For respondents present in all three waves, we corrected inconsistencies as reported in Table \ref{tab:Inconsistencies}. We assumed that if diabetes was reported only once in the first two waves (either in 2002 or 2005) and then not reported again in the ensuing waves, this diabetes report was likely to be false (see lines 3 and 4 in Table \ref{tab:Inconsistencies}) and that the person never had received a diagnosis. If a diabetes diagnosis was however reported in two of the three waves (in 2002 and 2009 but not 2005, or in 2002 and 2005 but not in 2009) we assumed that the respondent had diabetes in all three waves (see lines 1 and 2 in Table \ref{tab:Inconsistencies}). For cases where we only had information from two waves, we assumed that if a diabetes diagnosis had been reported in a prior wave they also had diabetes in the ensuing wave, even if it was not reported in the latter (see lines 5 and 6 in Table \ref{tab:Inconsistencies}), given that most diabetes self-reports tend to be correct.


\begin{center}
	\textbf{Table \ref{tab:Inconsistencies} about here}
\end{center}




We then tested if those respondents we categorized as not having a diabetes diagnosis based on above rules were actually more likely to not have diabetes, using the biomarker data from wave 3. Of those with inconsistencies in their diabetes self-reports, 95 were present in the biomarker sample (46 with two self-reports (from lines 3 and 4 in Table \ref{tab:Inconsistencies}) and 49 with one self-report of diabetes (from lines 1 and 2 in Table \ref{tab:Inconsistencies})). Figure \ref{fig:kdens_inconsistency_hba1c} illustrates the difference between both groups and suggests that indeed those with two self-reports of diabetes are much more likely to have \ac{HbA1c} values above the diabetes threshold. A t-test comparing the mean \ac{HbA1c} for the two groups indicates that those with two self-reports also have significantly (p<0.001) higher \ac{HbA1c} levels than those with only one self-report of diabetes (9.7\% vs. 7.1\%). Further, of those with one self-report,  only 30\% have an \ac{HbA1c}$\geq6.5$\% compared to 87\% of those with two self-reports. Based on these results it appears that we did minimize misclassification of people into diabetes or no-diabetes. 

Alternatively we also test if using an alternative strategy, i.e. assuming that everybody who reported  a diabetes diagnosis once had diabetes in any later wave, would lead to different estimation results. We do not find this to be the case and find only minor differences in the point estimates of the coefficients (results available on request).
