\begin{abstract}
Diabetes is increasingly recognized as a major health risk in high income as well as middle income countries. While adverse economic effects of diabetes are highly plausible, the existing empirical evidence is limited. This paper investigates the impact of diabetes on labor market outcomes focusing on Mexico, a country with high and rising diabetes rates. Two challenges present themselves when using survey data to examine this relationship: (1) causality is hard to identify, and (2) diabetes is typically self-reported, potentially leading to biased estimates. The paper makes headway on both fronts using rich panel and biomarker data. Applying fixed effects estimation, we account for time-invariant omitted variables, providing an improved identification strategy. The results indicate a negative effect of self-reported diabetes on the probability of employment of around 5 percentage points, which increases in magnitude as time since diagnosis accumulates. By contrast we find no consistent evidence for an impact on wages or hours worked. Relying on objectively measured biomarker data --- available in one cross-section only --- in order to capture both those aware and unaware of having the condition also suggests a negative, albeit smaller, relationship with the probability of employment. Further analysis reveals that this inverse relationship of diabetes with employment is driven mainly by the inverse relationship found for self-reported diabetes, while no such association is visible for those unaware of having diabetes. This difference may be due to worse health in the diagnosed group as well as the effects of the additional health information provided by a diagnosis itself.

\section{\label{sec:Introduction}Introduction }

Diabetes, and particularly the most common \ac{T2DM}, has increased worldwide and is expected to continue to rise over the next decades \parencite{Risk2016}. It has become a problem for \ac{MICs} and \ac{HICs} alike, with over two-thirds of people with diabetes living in the developing world \parencite{InternationalDiabetesFederation2013}. Mexicans and Mexican-Americans appear to be particularly affected by diabetes, also in comparison to other Latino populations living in the \ac{USA} \parencite{Schneiderman2014}. In Mexico itself diabetes prevalence has been estimated to have grown from 6.7\% in 1994 to 14.4\% in 2006, including both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases \parencite{Barquera2013} and is expected to increase further over the next decades \parencite{Meza2015}. Already now, diabetes is the number one cause of death in Mexico \parencite{Barquera2013}. 

The observed trend has been attributed to a deterioration in diet and a reduction in physical activity \parencite{Barquera2008b,Basu2013}, while genetic predisposition among Mexicans with pre-hispanic ancestry may also have played a role \parencite{Williams2013}. Recent evidence indicates that the onset of diabetes has been occurring at an ever earlier age in Mexico \parencite{Villalpando2010}. With treatment as ineffective as it currently is --- only a minority achieves adequate blood glucose control  \parencite{Barquera2013} --- the earlier onset will increase the likelihood of complications during the productive lifespan. 

Diabetes is a term used to describe various conditions characterized by high blood glucose values, with the predominant disease being \ac{T2DM}, which we will henceforth refer to when using the term diabetes. The elevated
blood glucose levels that are a result of the body's inability to use insulin properly to maintain blood glucose at normal levels, can entail a range of adverse health effects for the individual concerned. However, via effective self-management of the disease much if not all of the complications can be avoided. In the absence of effective self-management ---or in the case of inadequate treatment--- diabetes has been documented to lead to conditions such as heart  disease and stroke, blindness, kidney problems, and nerve problems that together with impaired wound healing can lead to the loss of limbs \parencite{Reynoso-Noveron2011}. These conditions can be seriously debilitating and may therefore reduce an individual's economic activity, including his productivity and labor market participation.  Those who are able to "reverse" their diabetes --- meaning they manage to return to healthy blood glucose levels as a result of lifestyle changes and medication that re-establish normal insulin sensitivity --- are unlikely to suffer from any diabetes related health problems \parencite{Lim2011, Gregg2012}.

The effect of diabetes on labor market outcomes has been studied predominantly in \ac{HIC} ---with the exception of a study on Mexico \autocite{Seuring2015} and one on China \parencite{Liu2014} each. In the \ac{HIC} studies diabetes has been found to be associated with reductions in employment probabilities as well as wages and labor supply \parencite{Brown2005,Brown2014,BrownIII2011,Minor2010,Minor2013,Minor2015,Latif2009,Seuring2015a}.

However, while these studies have provided useful evidence of the potential labor market effects of diabetes, many of the complexities of the relationship have not been comprehensively addressed in any given study. First of all, unobserved heterogeneity presents a challenge to estimate the relationship between diabetes and labor outcomes. Especially time-invariant unobserved individual characteristics, e.g. health endowments--- often related to health during uteru, infant and child years, and to low household income or adverse health shocks during these early years--- as well as risk preferences have been shown to adversely affect health in general and the propensity to develop type 2 diabetes more specifically \parencite{VanEwijk2011,Sotomayor2013,Li2010b}. These and other unobserved personal characteristics (e.g. ability) may also affect employment probabilities, wages or working hours directly through their effects on contemporaneous productivity \parencite{Currie2013} and indirectly by limiting educational attainment and human capital accumulation \parencite{Ayyagari2011a}. Further, only focusing on the overall effect of a self-reported diabetes diagnosis does not reveal when potential labor market penalties appear, given the dynamic aspect of diabetes and the potential differences in its effects over time. Additionally, apart from its health effects diabetes might also affect labor market outcomes through other channels. For instance, people aware of their condition may be less inclined to continue working if this interferes with their disease management; they may also use the diagnosis as a justification for decreasing their labor supply, leading to a potential justification bias in the estimated effect of diabetes \parencite{Kapteyn2009}. Importantly, for these reasons the labor market effects may also be distinct for people with self-reported versus those with undiagnosed diabetes, potentially leading to biased estimates if the analysis is solely based on self-reports.

The objective of this study is to provide new evidence on the impact of diabetes on labor outcomes, while improving upon previous work by paying close attention to the above challenges. We use three waves of panel data from Mexico provided by the \ac{MxFLS} covering the period 2002--2012. The \ac{MxFLS} is particularly useful for the analysis of diabetes as it allows us to account for the above complexities in a more refined way than has been the case so far. Using individual level \ac{FE} analysis for the first time in this literature, we take account of time-invariant heterogeneity when assessing the impact of self-reported diabetes and self-reported diabetes duration on labor market outcomes.\footnote{We are not aware of any other evidence on the effect on wages and working hours in a \ac{MIC}.} Further, we add to the current literature in exploring the role of undiagnosed diabetes, using novel and rich biomarker data - an issue of considerable importance in light of the large prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes (see \textcite{Beagley2014}) that remained unaccounted for in earlier studies which typically rely on self-reported information. Doing so sheds light on the issue of measurement error and the potentially differential effects of self-reported and undiagnosed diabetes. 

Our  results using self-reported diabetes suggest an economically important decrease in employment probabilities for people aware of their disease. Wages and working hours, however, do not appear to be negatively associated with self-reported diabetes. We further find that employment probabilities are reduced with each additional year since diagnosis, with some evidence for an even larger effect per year after the initial 10 years. 

The biomarker analysis indicates that self-reported diabetes is associated with a higher employment penalty, compared to biometrically measured diabetes. Overall, undiagnosed diabetes does not appear to affect any of the labor market outcomes examined here, suggesting that adverse effects mainly occur to those self-reporting a diagnosis. We argue that, nonetheless, the effects found for self-reported diabetes in this study are largely unbiased as long as inference is not extended to the unobserved undiagnosed population, and are economically important in light of the considerable size of the diagnosed population in Mexico.


\section{\label{sec:Labor  outcomes and diabetes literature} Diabetes and labor outcomes -- existing evidence }

Several studies have investigated the effects of diabetes on labor market outcomes. 

For the \ac{USA}, \textcite{Brown2005} estimate  the impact on employment in 1996--1997 in an elderly population of Mexican Americans, living close to the Mexican border, using a bivariate probit model. The study finds diabetes to be endogenous for women but not for men.  For the latter, the estimates show a significant adverse effect of 7 \ac{p.p.}. For women, the negative effect becomes insignificant when using \ac{IV} estimation. In another study, again for a Mexican-American sample, \textcite{BrownIII2011} look at how diabetes management, inferred from measured \ac{HbA1c} levels, is associated with employment chances and wages using cross-sectional \ac{USA} data. The authors detect a linear negative association between \ac{HbA1c} levels and both employment chances and wages for men. Two further studies also examine the impact of diabetes on employment and productivity for the \ac{USA}: \textcite{Minor2010} focuses on the effect of diabetes on female employment, earnings, working hours and lost work days in 2006, finding diabetes to be endogenous and its effect underestimated if exogeneity is assumed. In the \ac{IV} estimates, diabetes has a significant negative effect on female employment as well as annual earnings but not on working hours. Both studies use a Heckman selection model to adjust for a possible selection bias, though, neither discusses the validity of the underlying exclusion restriction. In a later study \textcite{Minor2013} investigates the relationship of diabetes duration and labor market outcomes using a cross-sectional analysis, providing evidence of a non-linear relationship, with employment probabilities declining shortly after diagnosis for men and after about 10 years for women; wages are not affected by duration. Finally, a recent study by \textcite{Minor2015} investigates the association of self-reported diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes with employment probabilities and working hours in an adult USA population, using cross-sectional data. This study indicates a reduction in the coefficient size of diabetes if undiagnosed diabetes cases are included in the diabetes indicator instead of only self-reported diabetes. Further, they find that there is no association of undiagnosed diabetes with employment probabilities itself. However, the results of the study, particularly those for undiagnosed diabetes, are based on a very small number of cases, warranting further investigation.

For Canada, \textcite{Latif2009} estimate the effect of the disease on employment probabilities using an \ac{IV} strategy similar to \textcite{Brown2005}. His results suggest diabetes to be exogenous for females, and both endogenous and overestimated for males in the univariate model, with the estimates of the bivariate model indicating a significant negative impact on the employment probabilities for women, but not for men. For Australia, \textcite{Zhang2009} analyze the effects of diabetes on labor force participation using a multivariate endogeneous probit model. Their results demonstrate reduced labor market participation for males and females as a result of diabetes, with the effects appearing overstated if the endogeneity of diabetes is unaccounted for. 

To the best of our knowledge only two studies exist for non-\ac{HICs} by our knowledge. \textcite{Liu2014} investigate the effect of diabetes diagnosis on labor income in China, exploiting a natural experiment to identify causality and find a significant reduction in income for those with a recent diagnosis. An earlier study for Mexico explored the effect of self-reported diabetes on the probability of employment using only cross-sectional data from the 2005 wave of the \ac{MxFLS}, and found a significant (p<0.01) reduction in employment chances for males by about 10 \ac{p.p.} and for females by about 4.5 (p<0.1) \ac{p.p.}, using parental diabetes as an \ac{IV} \parencite{Seuring2015}. The scarcity of evidence for \ac{LMICs} is also underlined in a recent systematic review of the economic cost of diabetes \parencite{Seuring2015a}. 


Overall, the majority of existing studies, including those on high income countries, tend to suffer from at least four key limitations: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item  They rely exclusively on cross-sectional data, unable to account for unobserved characteristics.
\item The use of the family history of diabetes, which has been the sole instrumental variable employed so far, relies on the genetic and heritable component of \ac{T2DM} that could theoretically provide valid identification of the true effect of diabetes. However, it remains unclear whether the variable fully satisfies the exclusion restriction, as it may also proxy for other genetically transferred traits, including unobserved abilities that impact labor outcomes directly. This traditional identification strategy also abstracts from intrahousehold or intergenerational labor supply effects \parencite{Seuring2015}.\footnote{It is conceivable that diabetes might deteriorate parental health in such a way that the offspring either has to give up their employment to provide care, or has to increase labor supply to compensate for lost income.}
\item The use of self-reported diabetes can introduce non-classical measurement error due to systematic misreporting which has been shown to cause estimates of economic impacts to be potentially biased and overstated \parencite{Cawley2015,ONeill2013,Perks2015}.
\item A final potential limitation lies the selection into diagnosis as a result of disease severity: those who are more severely ill are more likely to have visited a medical doctor and be diagnosed.  
\end{enumerate}

As mentioned before, to overcome some of these limitations, this paper applies an individual level \ac{FE} panel estimation strategy and makes use of biomarker data. We also estimate more detailed for different types of employment, i.e. non-agricultural employment, agricultural employment and self-employment, as ill health may have distinct effects across these activities.
\section{\label{sec:Data}Data}

We use the \acf{MxFLS}, a nationally representative, longitudinal household survey, which has three waves conducted in 2002, 2005--2006 and 2009--2012. All household members aged 15 and above were interviewed, covering information on a wide range of social, demographic, economic and health characteristics of the individuals and their families \parencite{Rubalcava2013}. Apart from self-reported diabetes information that is available in all rounds, we also use information on the self-reported year of diagnosis as well as biomarker data including \ac{HbA1c} levels for a subsample of respondents.  Our main analysis uses all three waves taking advantage of the large amount of observations and the panel structure of the data. Our variable of interest is self-reported diabetes, which is based on the survey question: "Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?".

Because the response to this question may well suffer from measurement error due to recall bias, we investigate and try to increase the consistency of the self-reported diabetes variable, using disease information from earlier and ensuing waves to infer on the current, missing or inconsistent, diabetes status (see Appendix \ref{sec:Appendix} for further details on our correction procedures.) A further, and no less important, source of measurement error is the omission of those with undiagnosed diabetes. In order to investigate how this may affect estimates of the labor market impact of diabetes we use information from a subsample containing over 6000 respondents (everybody aged 45+  and a random subsample of those aged 15--44 \parencite{Crimmins2015}) of the 2009-2012 wave that have biometrically measured diabetes to identify those with undiagnosed diabetes. 

For the entire paper the samples we use are restricted to the working age population (15--64). To prevent pregnant women from biasing our results due to the increased diabetes risk during pregnancy and its effects on female employment status, we have dropped all observations of women reporting to be pregnant at the time of the survey (N=764). We further exclude everybody currently in school.

The detailed information in the \ac{MxFLS} allows us to construct the following outcome variables of interest: employment\footnote{Employment status is defined as having worked or carried out an activity that helped with the household expenses the last week and working for at least four hours per week. This explicitly includes those employed informally, for instance people working in a family business.}, hourly wage and weekly working hours\footnote{Hourly wage was calculated by adding up the reported monthly income from the first and second job (if any) and dividing it by the average number of weeks per month. This gave us the average earnings per week which was then divided by the weekly working hours to arrive at an hourly wage estimate. Labor income was either reported as the total amount for the whole month or more detailed containing information on the monthly wage, income from piecework, tips, extra hours, meals, housing, transport, medical benefits and other earnings. Over 80\% of respondents reported the total amount instead of a detailed amount. Respondents were also asked for their annual income and we used that information to arrive at an hourly wage if information for monthly labor income was missing. Finally, we adjusted the calculated wage for inflation from the year of the interview up to 2013 and took the log of those values. Due to a considerable number of missing or zero income reports the sample used for the wage estimation is smaller than the sample for working hours. Working hours were calculated summing up the self-reported working hours of the first and ---if applicable--- the second job.} For the pooled data of all three waves (Table  \ref{tab:Pooled-sample-characteristics}), diabetes was self-reported by 5\% of men and 6\% of women. Taking into account the different age groups, this is consistent with other prevalence estimates of self-reported diabetes for this time period in Mexico.\footnote{\textcite{Barquera2013} show that the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes in Mexico was 7.5\% in 2006, only somewhat above our results, which may be the result of the slightly different age groups considered.}  Most of the respondents in the sample either live in rural or in large urbanized areas. Looking at our outcome variables, 87\% of men report some form of employment compared to 37\% of women. Interestingly, men do not report considerably higher hourly wages than women but work more hours per week. Also, men are working more often in agricultural jobs while women are more likely to be self-employed or in non-agricultural employment. Women also have lower educational attainment on average. 



Turning to the biomarker subsample of the third wave (2009-2012), respondents are somewhat older on average than in the pooled sample, as it includes everybody above the age of 44 but only a random subsample of those aged 44 or below (\cite{Crimmins2015}). Also, self-reported diabetes is higher than in the pooled sample as well as in the full sample of wave three. Regarding the other control and outcome variables, the sample is fairly similar to the pooled sample. Remarkably, a relatively large share of people have an \ac{HbA1c} indicative of diabetes, defined by the \ac{WHO} as levels above or equal 6.5\% \parencite{WorldHealthOrganization2011}\footnote{In one of the first analyzes of these new biomarker data \textcite{Frankenberg2015} show that the rates in Mexico of elevated \ac{HbA1c} levels are very high when compared to \ac{HbA1c} data from similar surveys in the \ac{USA} and China. \parencite{Frankenberg2015}.}: 18\% of males and females have undiagnosed diabetes. This suggests that relying on self-reported diabetes as a measure for diabetes in Mexico might considerably understate the true extent of diabetes, potentially leading to biased estimates of its economic impact.

\section{\label{sec:Estimation Strategy}Estimation strategy}
 
\textcite{Strauss1998} provide a useful framework to think about the relationship between health and labor outcomes:
\begin{equation}
L=L(H, pc, w(H;S,A,B,I,\alpha,e_{w}), S, A, B, V, \xi) \label{eq:wage}
\end{equation}
where $L$ is labor supply or labor market participation, $pc $ is a vector of prices for consumer goods, $w$ is the real wage; $H$ is an array of measured health status ; $S$ is education; $A$ is a vector of demographic characteristics; $B$ is the family background of the individual; $I$captures the local community infrastructure; $\alpha$ is an array of unobservables (e.g. ability), $e_w$ represents the measurement error, $V$ is non-labor income and $\xi$ is the taste parameter. 

The equation showcases the joint effect of health on both wages and labor supply or labor market participation. Health affects labor supply and participation directly by impacting the ability to work and indirectly by changing wages.

There are several ways diabetes may affect $H$. First of all, diabetes can deteriorate health if it remains untreated, with the adverse effects potentially increasing over time. Second, a diagnosis of diabetes and ensuing treatment may lead to better health compared to the undiagnosed state. However, compared to healthy people even those receiving treatment for their diabetes may still have worse health outcomes. Third, there is also evidence that the diagnosis itself may affect one's own health perception and could lead to worse self-perceived health \parencite{Thoolen2006}. We therefore expect diabetes to adversely affect health and consequently labor market outcomes.

When estimating equation  \ref{eq:wage} empirically with observational data, unobserved heterogeneity may bias the results. As mentioned in section  \ref{sec:Introduction} unobserved factors captured in $\alpha$ such as early childhood investments, innate ability and time preference could affect wages as well as the probability to develop diabetes. Further, changes in lifestyle due to changes in wages or employment status may also affect the probability to develop diabetes through changes in diet and physical activity. Finally, measurement error $e_w$ may be an important issue due to the large undiagnosed population with diabetes, particularly if being diagnosed is related to employment or wages via better access to healthcare through employment benefits and higher income.

The following section describes our estimation strategy for the different parts of the data.


\subsection{Panel data on self-reported diabetes}

We investigate the relationship between self-reported diabetes and three
labor market outcomes: employment, wages and labour supply, respectively, using a \ac{FE} model. While using individual level \ac{FE} does not allow to fully identify a causal relationship, this strategy does improve on the degree of causal inference, compared to a simple cross-sectional analysis.\footnote{Other forms of unobserved heterogeneity could also affect our estimates --- for instance time-variant unobserved heterogeneity or omitted variables simultaneously driving labor outcomes and health} In particular it does allow controlling for unobserved personal characteristics that could bias the estimates, without the drawbacks of a less than convincing \ac{IV} strategy that has been widely applied in this literature. We have also estimated \ac{RE} models but do not present them here as the Hausman test suggested the use of the \ac{FE} model throughout.\footnote{Results are available on request.}


We estimate the following model:

\noindent 
\begin{equation}
Y_{it}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Diabetes_sr{it}+\beta_{2}X_{it}+c_{i}+\gamma_{t}+u_{it}.\label{eq:employed}
\end{equation}


where $Y_{it}$ is a binary variable taking a value of $1$ if respondent $i$ reports being in employment at time $t$ and $0$ otherwise, $Diabetes_{it}$ is a binary variable taking a value of $1$ at time $t$ if the respondent reports having ever received a diagnosis of diabetes\footnote{We are not able to distinguish between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes using this data, but given information from other studies that have tried to do this and found no association with labor market outcomes \parencite{Minor2010,Minor2015}, we think including those with type 1 diabetes likely attenuates any adverse relationship we may find.}, $X_{it}$ is a vector of control variables, $c_{i}$ represents an individual fixed effect, $\gamma_{t}$ represents a year dummies, and $u_{it}$ is the error term.

For the relationship of self-reported diabetes with wages and working hours our empirical models are estimated conditional on having positive wages and being employed, respectively. In these models $Y_{it}$ represents the log hourly wage of respondent $i$ at time $t$ or the weekly working hours over the last year.

The control variables in both \ac{FE} specifications include dummy variables to capture the effects of the living environment,
of living in a small, medium or large city with rural as the reference category, and state dummies. We also include a marital status and the number of children residing in the household below the age of 6 to control for the impact of marriage and children
on labor market outcomes and the effect of childbearing and related gestational diabetes on the probability of developing type 2 diabetes
\parencite{Bellamy2009}. To account for the effect of changes in household wealth on diabetes and employment probabilities, we use standard
principal component analysis of multiple indicators of household assets and housing conditions to create an indicator for household wealth
\parencite{Filmer2001}.\footnote{Our composite wealth index consists of owning a vehicle, a second house, a washing machine, dryer, stove, refrigerator or furniture, any electric appliances, any domestic appliances, a bicycle or farm animals. It further accounts for the physical condition of the house, proxied by the floor material of the house, and the type of water access.}. Finally, a quadratic age term and calendar year dummies are included to capture the non-linear effect of age and any trends over time, respectively.

Before moving on, it bears emphasizing that despite our efforts to reduce any bias in our estimates, the estimated coefficients do not reflect true causal effects since time-variant unobserved heterogeneity may still bias the estimates. With respect to employment status, one example would be that job loss affects lifestyle choices that increase the probability to develop diabetes, which could then in turn negatively affect labor market outcomes. So far, no strong adverse effects of being laid off on diabetes self-reports have been found in the literature \parencite{Bergemann2011,Schaller2015}, although this has only been researched in a high-income country context. Another example relates to stress at work, which has been linked to the development of type 2 diabetes \parencite{Heraclides2012,Eriksson2013}. However, while stress levels may change over time, a person's coping mechanisms to deal with stress are likely time-invariant \textcite{Schneiderman2005}. While we cannot exclude the role of these time variant unobserved factors, it seems that the role of time-invariant variables, e.g. genetic predisposition and relatively stable personality traits, is predominant. The applied \ac{FE} approach should then limit the bias due to these time-invariant confounding factors. 


\subsection{Self-reported diabetes duration}
To explore the role of the duration of diabetes for labor outcomes, we estimate the following model using a self-reported
measure of the years since diagnosis:


\begin{equation}
Y_{it}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Dyears_{it}+\beta_{2}X_{it}+c_{i}+u_{it},\label{eq:duration_linear}
\end{equation}


\noindent where $\beta_{1}Dyears_{it}$ is a continuous variable indicating years since first diabetes diagnosis.

In an effort to capture possible non-linearities in the relationship of interest we then use a spline function that allows for the effect of an additional year with diabetes to vary over time.
\begin{equation}
Y_{it}=\delta_{0}+g(Dyears_{it})+\delta_{2}X_{it}+c_{i}+u_{it}.\label{eq:splines}
\end{equation}


\noindent with $g(Dyears_{it})=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\delta_{n}\cdot max\{Dyears_{it}-\eta_{n-1}\}I_{in}$ and $I_{in}=1[\eta_{n-1}\leq Dyears_{it}<\eta_{n}]$, with $\eta_{n}$ being the place of the $n$-th node for $n=1,2,\ldots,N$. We choose three nodes that - based on visual inspection (see Figures \ref{fig:Kernel-weighted-local-polynomial_empl}, \ref{fig:Kernel-weighted-local-polynomial_wage} and \ref{fig:Kernel-weighted-local-polynomial_workhrs} in the result section) - best captured any possible non-linearity in the
relationship between diabetes duration and labor outcomes. These are located at 4, 11 and 20 years after diagnosis. The
first four years should capture any immediate effects of the diagnosis, the years five to eleven should capture any effects of adaptation to the disease. After 11 years it is conceivable that many of the debilitating complications of diabetes would appear that could deteriorate health and lead to adverse effects on labor market outcomes. The coefficient $\delta_{n}$ captures the effect of diabetes for the $n$-th interval. The effects are linear if $\delta_{1}=\delta_{2}=,\ldots,=\delta_{n}$.

Because the year of diagnosis was only reported in the third wave, duration of diabetes (or time since diagnosis) for the earlier waves was only calculated for those that had also responded to the third wave.\footnote{To arrive at the time passed since diagnosis, the year of diagnosis was subtracted from the year of the interview.}

One caveat of using \ac{FE} is that, when year dummies are included, any variable that varies by one unit in each time period, is not separately identified \parencite{Wooldridge2012}. Because this is also the case for diabetes duration, in equations (\ref{eq:duration_linear}) and (\ref{eq:splines}), identification of this variable relies on the presence of people without diabetes in the sample, for which diabetes duration does not increase at the same rate as time.\footnote{Consequently, those that reported a diagnosis in the year of the interview were counted as 'one year since diagnosis'. From this follows that if the respondent reported to having been diagnosed in the year before the interview he or she was counted as 'two years since diagnosis' and so on.} As a further robustness check, we also estimate two models that only use between-individuals variation, i.e. a \ac{LPM} that uses only data from the third wave, the only wave where year of diagnosis was originally reported and a pooled \ac{LPM} that used data from all three waves.\footnote{We also estimate all models excluding the calendar year dummies and this gives similar results.}

\subsection{\label{sec:Biomarker Strategy}Cross-section: biomarker and self-reported data}

Self-reported diabetes only captures part of the diabetes population as many individuals remain undiagnosed; it may also contain cases of people who misreport having diabetes.  Estimations based on self-reports may therefore suffer from selection bias in at least three ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Systematic overreporting of diabetes: people without diabetes
may report a diabetes diagnosis, unintentionally --- for instance due to misdiagnosis, either from a health professional or because of self-diagnosis, or intentionally --- for instance with a view to justifying some other adverse event or status in their life (e.g. being unemployed). 
\item Systematic underreporting of diabetes: people with diabetes may also underreport because they are concerned about negative stigma associated with the condition. Furthermore, diabetes often remains undiagnosed leaving people unaware of their condition.\footnote{More formally, assume that the true model of the effect of diabetes on labor market outcomes is $y^=X^{*}\beta+\epsilon$. Because we do not observe the true values of  $X^{*}$  we have to use self-reported measures that contain errors: $X=X^{*} + u$. Since $u$ may be correlated with $\epsilon$ - in contrast to classic measurement error which is randomly distributed, we cannot sign the bias of  $\beta$.} 
\item Diagnosis is more likely for those who are more likely to have visited a doctor, for instance because they are more affected by the condition, wealthier, or hypchondric.   
\end{enumerate} 

Overreporting may attenuate the effect of diabetes if those falsely reporting a diabetes diagnosis are in fact in good health; it may also lead to overestimation of the impact if some of those misreports reflect other factors that negatively affect labor outcomes (e.g. other illnesses or general ill health), or if they are used to justify other adverse events that may negatively affect labor outcomes. Similarly, underreporting may lead to overestimation if those with undiagnosed diabetes are generally healthier, hence more likely to have positive labor market outcomes than those with self-reported diabetes. However, if the undiagnosed and the diagnosed groups are similar in terms of health, then this would lead to an underestimation of the effect of diabetes. 

The health information received at a diabetes diagnosis may also have an effect in itself. It may for instance affect an individual's psychology which in turn may influence economic behavior. Two studies found a diabetes diagnosis and subsequent treatment to increase the odds of psychological problems, including depression and anxiety \parencite{Thoolen2006,Paddison2011}, while similar results have not been found for people with undiagnosed diabetes \parencite{Nouwen2011}. Looking at behavioral change, health information  has been shown to affect behavior after the diagnosis of not only diabetes \parencite{Slade2012} but also of other chronic diseases (see \textcite{Baird2014,Gong2015,Thornton2008,Zhao2013a}). However, little is known about the effects of health information on labor market outcomes. For diabetes, only \textcite{Liu2014} investigate the effect of receiving a diabetes diagnosis on labor income in Chinese employees. This study finds a reduction in labor, income which was attributed to the psychological effects of the diagnosis.\footnote{In a very different context \textcite{Dillon2014}, using a randomised intervention, find that the news stemming from diagnosis of malaria affects productivity and income, but not labor supply among sugar cane cutters in Nigeria.} 


The use of biomarker data allows to explore the relationship of measured diabetes with labor outcomes. The estimated relationship from those can then be compared to the estimated impact of self-reported diabetes. The biomarker data also enables us to look at diabetes severity, as measured by \ac{HbA1c} values. Since this data is only available for one wave ---the most recent--- our analysis here is limited to cross-section data. Moreover,as mentioned above, biomarkers were only taken from about one-third  of the initial representative sample, which is still a sizable number, but no longer directly comparable to the panel-based results in this paper. Nonetheless, it allows for a first exploration of the relationships of undiagnosed diabetes and disease severity with labor market outcomes. 

Our analysis of the biomarker sample consists of three steps. We first estimate Eq. \ref{eq:diab_sr} to assess the association of self reported diabetes with labor outcomes, as before, but this time for the biomarker sample only, using the following specification:
\begin{equation}
Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Dsr_{i}+\beta_{2}X_{i}+c_{i}+u_{i}\label{eq:diab_sr}
\end{equation}

We then estimate the relations between diabetes as defined by biomarker and labor outcomes, by estimating the following equation:

\begin{equation}
Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}D_all_{i}+\beta_{2}X_{i}+c_{i}+u_{i}\label{eq:diab}
\end{equation}

Here $D_all{i}$ is equal to $1$ if HbA1c $\geq6.5\%$ or if a diabetes diagnosis is self-reported, which gives us an idea of the association of our outcomes with diabetes, using the entire diabetes population.\footnote{We include in $D_all{i}$ also those that self-reported a diabetes diagnosis but had \ac{HbA1c} levels below the diabetes threshold. These people may have received a diabetes diagnosis but are well controlled and have \ac{HbA1c} levels below the threshold. We therefore do not assume that they falsely reported a diagnosis. We also estimated models without making this assumption with the results being very similar to those presented here.} 

To find the effect of undiagnosed diabetes we include both variables at the same time and estimate:

\begin{equation}
Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Dsr_{i}+\beta_{2}D_{i}+\beta_{3}X_{i}+v_{i}+u_{i}.\label{eq:diab_ud}
\end{equation}

This also informs us about the effect of self-reporting over and above biomarker analysis, which we find by considering $\beta_{1}Dsr_{i}-\beta_{2}D_all_{i}$.

For the biomarker analysis we rely on within household variation $v_{i}$ for identification in these models to account for unobserved community characteristics, such as the access to healthcare and the quality of healthcare in the community, poverty and unemployment levels in the community or the amount of public green space and recreational possibilities available. These factors potentially affect both the propensity to develop diabetes and to receive a diagnosis; they may also be related to labor market outcomes.\footnote{We did not account for fixed household characteristics as the average number of observations per household was close to one, i.e. for most households only one member provided biomarker information in our subsample, significantly limiting the variation within households that would be needed for identification.}

\section{\label{sec:RESULTS} Results}


\subsection{Incidence of self-reported diabetes}

Table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-and} presents the estimation
results of the \ac{FE} model using equation \ref{eq:employed}, which indicate significant and substantial reductions in the probability of employment for men and women with self-reported diabetes. The effects are surprisingly similar across both sexes showing a reduction in
employment probabilities of over 5 \ac{p.p.}.

The results in Columns 3--6 indicate no significant relationship between self-reported diabetes and wages or working hours. One may expect this relationship to differ by the type of work, as those  with diabetes working in an agricultural job that requires strenuous, physical efforts may see their productivity more adversely affected than those engaged in more sedentary work. We therefore estimate a model including interaction terms between self-reported diabetes and agricultural employment and between self-reported diabetes and self-employment, respectively, using non-agricultural employment as the comparison group, and restricting our sample to those employed only.

The results in Table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-interaction} show that while male agricultural workers have lower wages in general, the relationship with diabetes does not depend on the type of work, as none of the interaction terms show up significant. In the working hours regression one interaction term is significant, suggesting that those with self reported diabetes working in agriculture supply 5 hours less relative to non-agricultural workers and employees. However, because we have more than two work types we cannot draw conclusions
solely on the basis of the t-statistic. We therefore perform a Wald test for the overall significance of the interaction term which does
not reject the null of no interaction effects ($p = .15$), indicating that the effect of diabetes on working hours does not vary significantly by type of work. 

In summary, we find no evidence for an association between self-reported diabetes and wages or working hours. The lack of effects at the intensive margin may be explained by selection: potentially, only those with "mild" or asymptomatic diabetes are still in the same job continuing to earn similar wages. Only once complications become increasingly severe would they switch activity (or drop out of the labor market), without going through a notable phase of reduced productivity and labor supply.

To explore whether diabetes affects the selection into certain types of work we estimate \ac{FE} models of the probability of being in non-agricultural employment, agricultural employment or self-employment using three dummy variables indicating the respective type of work as the left hand side variables. The results in Table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-selection_LPM} indicate a negative association with self-employment, though the estimates are quite imprecise. For women, those who self report diabetes are less likely to work in agriculture and potentially self-employment. This may suggest that having diabetes drives people out of self-employment and agricultural jobs, for instance because these jobs are physically more demanding and possibly also because they provide less protection in terms of insurance and employment duration. We also estimated a pooled multinomial logit model augmented  with the within-between approach \parencite{Bell2015}, based on the work of \textcite{Mundlak1978}, which allows interpreting the coefficients of all time-varying variables as within-effects by including individual means of all time-varying covariates\footnote{Several other studies in economics have used this approach recently, e.g., \textcite{Geishecker2011,Wunder2014,Boll2016}}. The results indicate a very similar pattern both in size and significance (results available on request).\footnote{Using the same methods, we also investigated the impact of diabetes on changes in the type of work restricted to those in employment, finding no evidence that diabetes leads to changes in the type of work. These results are also available on request.}

\subsection{Duration of self-reported  diabetes }


Because diabetes is a chronic and generally life-long disease, we investigate how soon after the first diagnosis diabetes may affect labor market outcomes. Given that complications of diabetes develop over time the effect may increase linearly as the years go by. Non-linear relationships are also plausible: health problems that have led to the diagnosis as well as psychological effects after the diagnosis may affect labor market outcomes immediately after having been diagnosed with diabetes. Similarly management of the disease may be successful only after some initial period. It is also possible that after some time complications start to appear, again reducing health and leading to reductions in labor supply and productivity.


To obtain a first idea of the relationship between our outcome variables and diabetes duration we use a non-parametric kernel-weighted local polynomial regression. As Figure \ref{fig:Kernel-weighted-local-polynomial_empl} shows, the relationship between diabetes duration and the probability of employment for men shows a more or less steady decline which becomes more pronounced as time progresses. For women,
a first drop-off occurs right after diagnosis; thereafter no consistent pattern is observed.\footnote{Since long run estimations suffer from large standard errors --- as sample size is strongly reduced --- this limits its interpretation and we therefore truncate the graphs at a disease duration of 24 years}. A similar analysis for wages shows somewhat more erratic relationships, although there seems to be a long term negative trend for women but not for men (see figures \ref{fig:Kernel-weighted-local-polynomial_wage} and \ref{fig:Kernel-weighted-local-polynomial_workhrs}).  A similar negative trend can be observed for working hours for women, but not for men.

Table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-duration} presents the results of the linear and non-linear duration models (for which we created the following splines to capture the immediate, intermediate and long-term relationships:0--4,
5--11, 12--19 and 20+), starting with the results of the cross-sectional \ac{LPM}, followed by the pooled \ac{LPM} and then the \ac{FE} model as specified in equations (\ref{eq:duration_linear}) and (\ref{eq:splines}).

For employment probabilities the results indicate a yearly reduction in male employment probability throughout. For women the coefficient shows a reduction of up to almost 1 \ac{p.p.} per year, though the association is not as strong. The coefficients in the spline models provide some evidence for an immediate effect of diabetes, which then levels off for some time after which it becomes stronger again. Nonetheless, for males and particularly females, the coefficients are quite imprecisely measured.

Turning to wages, the \ac{FE} model indicates a reduction in female wages of about 7\% per year with diabetes. This finding is, however, not supported by the other estimated models. For men we find no consistent effect. The results of the non-linear specification indicate that there may be a reduction in wages 5--11 years after the initial diagnosis. We also find associations for women with more than 20 years of diabetes, but these estimates may be spurious due to the considerably reduced number of observations in this group.\footnote{There are only 9 and 3 observations for male and female wages with more than 20 years since diagnosis in wave 3, respectively, and similarly 17 and 7 in the pooled sample, respectively. For male and female working hours there are 12 and 7 observations with more than 20 years since diagnosis in wave 3, respectively, and 20 and 12 for the pooled sample, respectively.}. There appears to be no consistent relationship between working hours and time since being diagnosed with diabetes.
   

Overall these results suggest a fairly constant decrease in the probability of employment for both men and women and in earnings for women, which contrast with estimates for the \ac{USA} \parencite{Minor2013}, where no such linear relationship is observed.  \textcite{Minor2013} finds a reduction in employment probabilities of 82 \ac{p.p.} for females after 11 to 15 years and a reduction of 60 \ac{p.p.} for males after 2-5 years, indicating very large employment penalties, in particular in comparison to our results for Mexico, though our non-linear results are not directly comparable to these estimates as Minor used pooled cross-sectional data, constructed dummy variables instead of splines and used different duration groups.\footnote{We estimated a comparable model to that of \textcite{Minor2013} using dummy variables and find a significant reduction in employment chances throughout, regardless of whether we use our duration groups to construct the dummies or the duration groups used by \textcite{Minor2013}. For men, we find a significant reduction of about 6 to 12 \ac{p.p.}, depending on the used specification, in the first 2 and 4 years after diagnosis, respectively. In the following years the effect size tends to increase somewhat. For women, we find less evidence for an immediate effect of diagnosis, but effects do emerge after about 2 years of living with the disease and also increase somewhat over time. These results are available on request.}

\subsection{Cross-sectional biomarker analysis}


In this section we gain additional insights from using the biomarker data collected in the
third wave of the \ac{MxFLS}. As noted in section \ref{sec:Data}, these data enable us to identify respondents with
\ac{HbA1c} levels equal to or above the internationally recognized diabetes threshold of 6.5\%. This will allow the investigation of the direction of bias introduced when relying on self-reported diabetes onlyand it is not possible to identify the undiagnosed as well. All estimations are carried out using the biomarker sample to make them comparable.

We first present a cross tabulation of self-reported diabetes and the results of the biomarker analysis (Table  \ref{tab:Biomarker_observations}). The column\% for column 1 shows that overall, 29\% of the sample have \ac{HbA1c} levels indicative of diabetes or self-report a diabetes diagnosis. Of the people with diabetes according to biomarker analysis, 37\% self-report a diagnosis, while 63\% do not. In what follows we investigate how this last group, the undiagnosed, are affected by (undiagnosed) diabetes in their labour outcomes.

To further investigate the relationship of self-reported and biomarker tested diabetes, we estimate the models presented in section \ref{sec:Biomarker Strategy}.  
The results in columns 1 and 2 of Table \ref{tab:Biomarker_results} show that the earlier results are robust for the biomarker sample. The coefficients in column 2 and 3 indicate that the associations with employment probabilities are much weaker considering diabetes when using diabetes defined by the biomarker instead of self-reported diabetes. In columns 5 and 6, obtained from estimating equation \ref{eq:diab_ud}, the coefficient for the biomarker diabetes population $D_bio_i$ now reflects the effect of undiagnosed diabetes, as the regression includes a control for self-reported diabetes, and reveals that undiagnosed diabetes is not associated with any of the labor outcomes. Finally, by subtracting the coefficients of self-reported diabetes from the overall diabetes population we obtain the association for self-reported diabetes after controlling for undiagnosed diabetes, indicating a similar association in size and significance as in the results from columns 1 and 2.

As discussed earlier, differences in effects between self-reported diabetes and the overall diabetes population including those undiagnosed are likely due to selection into the diagnosed population, such as differences in diabetes severity, making people with a more severe diabetes more likely to be diagnosed as well as to lose their job as a result of their diabetes. To further explore this, we estimate models additionally controlling for self-reported health status to capture differences in health. Secondly, we estimate models accounting for measured \ac{HbA1c} levels, to  investigate in how far current diabetes severity affects our labor outcomes. If current severity would be related to labor market outcomes and explain the difference between self-reported and the undiagnosed diabetes population, one would expect an adverse association with increasing \ac{HbA1c} levels, for both self-reporting and undiagnosed. To investigate this, we construct three dummy variables for \ac{HbA1c} groups above the diabetes threshold (i.e. 6.5--7.9, 8--11.9 and 12--14) and interact them with self-reported diabetes (Table \ref{tab:Diagnosed_undiagnosed_robust}, Panel B). As before, the biomarker coefficients provide information about the associations for those with undiagnosed diabetes.

When additionally controlling for subjective health status, we find that for men the difference between self-reported diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes is reduced due to a smaller coefficient for self-reported diabetes (Table \ref{tab:Diagnosed_undiagnosed_robust}, Panel A). For women, we also find a smaller difference, though the coefficient for self-reported diabetes remains largely unchanged.  Particularly for males, reporting bad health is associated with a reduction in employment probabilities, suggesting that it is the adverse effect of diabetes on health status in self-reporting males that is driving the reduction in employment probabilities, while it does not affect the coefficient of undiagnosed diabetes. For women additional factors may play a role. However, accounting for measures of overweight and obesity, self-reported hypertension, heart disease and depression does not further affect the interpretation of the diabetes coefficient (results available on request).

Turning to Panel B, for employment probabilities but we do not find an indication that the effect becomes worse with higher \ac{HbA1c} levels. We therefore conclude that current diabetes management or severity of diabetes are likely not associated with any labor outcome and do not explain the difference in effects between diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes.

To the best of our knowledge only one study has previously used biomarker data to analyze the relationship with labor market outcomes in a comparable population. \textcite{BrownIII2011} use data for a Mexican American population in a broadly comparable way to this paper, though stopping short of investigating the labor market impact of undiagnosed diabetes. Similar to us, the study finds that once diabetes is diagnosed, current management plays a minor role in determining labor market outcomes. This is not surprising given that \ac{HbA1c} levels only provide a picture of blood glucose levels over the last three months. They therefore may not be representative of blood glucose levels in the years before and after the diabetes diagnosis which ultimately determine how soon complications appear and how severe they will be.

\section{\label{sec:Conclusion}Conclusion}

Diabetes has become one of the most common chronic diseases in middle- and high-income countries, with the potential to severely impact the health and economic well-being of those directly (and possibly indirectly) affected. Yet there remains only limited 'hard' evidence on the economic consequences, especially in \ac{MICs}. Moreover, what evidence does exist at best partially tried to tackle the econometric challenges involved. 

We contribute to filling this gap by providing more advanced evidence on the labor market effects of diabetes, taking into account several methodological challenges that arise due to the nature of the disease and types of data available. To do this we use longitudinal panel data from Mexico, a \ac{MIC} for which the biomarker data used in this paper indicates that diabetes, and particularly undiagnosed diabetes, has reached alarming levels.

In this paper we have contributed to filling this gap by exploiting rich, longitudinal data from Mexico, a \ac{MIC} with alarmingly high levels of diagnosed and --- as our results highlighted --- undiagnosed diabetes. The paper makes a 
methodological contribution (beyond the geographic context), in that it --- for the first time --- comprehensively addresses several issues related to the estimation of labor market effects of diabetes. We account for the endogeneity of self-reported diabetes by estimating individual fixed effects, which allows us to cancel out the potential role of unobserved individual traits that likely affect both labor market outcomes and the propensity to self-report diabetes. Within this empirical framework, we further use information on the year of diagnosis to investigate the potential heterogeneity in the effect of self-reported diabetes on labor market outcomes over time. Finally, we have been able to investigate the potential bias in estimates relying on self-reported diabetes (which is still the most frequent measure in the previous literature), taking advantage of biomarker data that allows identifying the entire diabetes population, i.e. including those with undiagnosed diabetes. 

The first part of our results confirms a considerable gap in employment probabilities for both men and women reporting a diabetes diagnosis, compared to those that do not report the condition. We also find some evidence that diabetes is more likely to reduce the probability of employment in the agricultural and self-employment sector, characterized predominantly by informal arrangements, compared to the rest of the workforce. However, those who remain employed do not suffer any wage or labor supply effects, possibly because they are still relatively healthy or are able to resort to a type of work that does not entail their diabetes limiting their work-related performance. More research will be needed to confirm and further investigate this finding and interpretation. 

Regarding the heterogeneity in the effects of diabetes over time, our results indicate an adverse impact of self-reported diabetes on employment chances, with the impact growing in magnitude especially after the first 10 years post-diagnosis. This is plausible in that as time lived with diabetes evolves, complications associated with diabetes tend to become more frequent and more severe \parencite{Adler2003}. Looking at wages as our labor market outcome, we uncover some adverse effects for females, indicating a sizable reduction with time since diagnosis. These findings may bode ill for countries were diabetes has started appearing at an increasingly younger age, causing people to live with the disease for larger parts of their productive lifespan, possibly exacerbating the economic effects of reduced employment due to diabetes \parencite{Hu2011,Villalpando2010}.

The second part of our results indicates that only relying on self-reported diabetes can lead to an overestimation of the association of diabetes with labor market outcomes. We find that a negative association only exists for self-reported, but not undiagnosed diabetes. This perhaps surprising, notable difference, is likely mediated --- at least in the case of men --- by the subjective health status being worse for self-reporting compared to undiagnosed men. Current disease severity, as proxied by \ac{HbA1c} levels, does not appear to play an important role in this context.

Our findings bear several implications. First, when interpreting labor market impact estimates relying on self-reported diabetes, one cannot assume that the results extend to those with undiagnosed diabetes. However, the strategy of simply merging self-reported and undiagnosed in one diabetes category may not be optimal, as doing so will fail to account for the heterogeneity between the groups in the amount of health information they possess, the time they have already been exposed to elevated blood glucose levels and consequently their subjective as well as true health status, leading to a potentially important loss of information. If, by contrast, both groups are included into the model separately, thereby acknowledging their inherent differences, this allows us to gain information about the distribution of the economic burden across the two groups. 

Further, because the results of the biomarker analysis did also reveal that the coefficient of self-reported diabetes is not strongly affected by accounting for undiagnosed diabetes, it may be reasonable to assume that the estimates using self-reported diabetes in the \ac{FE} panel data analysis are still largely unbiased. The latter estimates should then of course only be used to draw conclusions about the effect of self-reported diabetes, not of diabetes overall. In the case of Mexico, given that more than 7\% of the Mexican population have been diagnosed with diabetes, the identified reduction in employment probabilities still amounts to a significant overall economic burden being associated with (diagnosed) diabetes.

Our results add further weight to the case for reducing the incidence and progression of diabetes. On top of the well-documented health benefits, it appears there are considerable potential gains to be had in terms of increasing the productive lifespan of people. This is of particular importance in \ac{LMICs}, where parental health shocks, related job loss and increasing health expenditures can have repercussions across the entire household. Other family members, including children, may be forced to increase their labor supply and to reduce non-health expenditures in order to prevent deterioration of the household's economic situation. This can lead to forgone investments into child education, showcasing the potential for adverse long-term effects of health shocks due to diabetes \parencite{Bratti2014}. Moreover, the large proportion of undiagnosed people indicates that diagnosis --- at least in Mexico --- happens too late or not at all, thereby significantly reducing the possibility to prevent complications via appropriate treatment and self-management, which has repercussions by increasing the risk of severe complications appearing early. Hence, much of the health and economic burden may be prevented by earlier diagnosis and, given the generally limited success in achieving good control in Mexico, better treatment of those already diagnosed with diabetes. Ultimately of course, there will be a need to invest in the prevention of diabetes cases in the first place. Taxation of sugar sweetened beverages may be one promising way forward \parencite{Colchero2016}, though the long-term effects in terms of diabetes prevention remain to be demonstrated.

Fortunately, the \ac{MxFLS} data provides several possibilities to assess the amount of misreporting and to attempt to reduce it before estimating the labor market effects of diabetes. In what follows we describe our approach of dealing with inconsistencies in self-reported diabetes over time.

One of the key advantages of panel data is in its repeated measurement for many of the individuals, thereby allowing to uncover inconsistencies for those with at least two observations. While we are not aware of any literature investigating the issue of inconsistencies in self-reported diabetes over time, a study by \textcite{Zajacova2010}, on the consistency of a self-reported cancer diagnosis over time in a USA population, found that 30\% of those who had reported a cancer diagnosis at an earlier point did report at a later point that they never had received a cancer diagnosis. They also found that a more recent diagnosis was reported with greater consistency possibly due to increasing recall problems and/or reduced salience as time since diagnosis progresses.

We also find inconsistencies in the diabetes self-reports over the three waves of the \ac{MxFLS} data, with between 10--20\% of those reporting diabetes in one wave not doing so in one of the subsequent waves. In order to reduce the amount of inconsistencies we were interested in the validity of diabetes self-reports. While we could not find a study assessing the validity of self-reported diabetes in Mexico, a study from China has shown that specificity of self-reported diabetes ---meaning that those who self-report a diabetes diagnosis actually have diabetes--- was very high (>98\% for China), while sensitivity ---a measure
of how many people with diabetes, diagnosed or undiagnosed, actually self-report the disease--- was low (40\% for China) \parencite{Yuan2015}. This indicates that people who report a diabetes diagnosis are likely to indeed have the condition while many of those not reporting a diabetes diagnosis are unaware of their diabetes.

We do something similar and assess the validity of self-reported diabetes in our data by using \ac{HbA1c} levels and the self-reports of diabetes related medicine use from wave three. We find that 90\% of those self-reporting a diabetes diagnosis had an \ac{HbA1c} $\geq6.5$\% or did report taking diabetes medication, indicating relatively high specificity in our data as well.

We used this information of relatively high specificity to infer the "true" diabetes status for those with inconsistent reports. For those with two waves, we assumed that if they reported a diabetes diagnosis in a prior wave they also had diabetes in the ensuing wave, even if they did not report a diabetes diagnosis.
For people where we had data from all three waves, we used that additional information to make a decision on how to deal with inconsistencies using the rules outlined in Table \ref{tab:Inconsistencies}

This approach should add more consistency to the self-reported diabetes information by using all available information. We tested if the results of the \ac{HbA1c} tests for the subpopulation in 2009 with biomarker information and inconsistencies in their diabetes reporting (n=96, 48 with two and 48 with one self-report of diabetes) would support this decision. Therefore we compared the mean \ac{HbA1c} values for those who had two self-reports of a diagnosis of diabetes in the full three waves with those with only one self-report. Using a t-test we found a significantly (p<0.001) higher mean \ac{HbA1c} of 9.6\%
for those with two self-reports compared to 7.0\% for those with only one self-report of diabetes. Further, of those with one self-report, only 30\% had an \ac{HbA1c}$\geq6.5$\% compared to 87\% of those with two self-reports. Based on these results we are reassured that the way we have dealt with the inconsistencies in the data minimizes misclassification of people into diabetes or no-diabetes and reduce some of the measurement error in the diabetes data. Unfortunately we cannot use a similar method for dealing with inconsistencies in the self-reported year of diabetes diagnosis as it has only been reported once. Hence, the results from duration analysis should be interpreted with care.
