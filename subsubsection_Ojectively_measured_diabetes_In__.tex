\subsubsection*{Ojectively measured diabetes}
In a first step we investigate the association of objectively measured diabetes and labour market outcomes by estimating equation \ref{eq:diab_objective}. This should give an indication of the effect of including those undiagnosed in the diabetes indicator on the association of diabetes with labour outcomes. The diabetes indicator variable still also contains those that self-reported a diabetes diagnosis but had \ac{HbA1c} levels below the diabetes threshold. This is to make the estimate more comparable to models with only self-reported diabetes.\footnote{Robustness checks where we specifically accounted for this subpopulation did not show qualitatively different results.} In order to have a comparison for the results using objectively measured diabetes, we first present the results taking only self-reported diabetes as our diabetes measure. The results in table \ref{tab:Self-reported_diabetes_biomarkersample} are similar to our findings from the panel data analysis indicating a reduction of between five and six percentage points in employment chances for people with self-reported diabetes and no significant associations for wages and working hours. Different to our panel data results, we find not strong association of self-reported diabetes with male employment chances. However, when running the same model using the entire third wave we find a significant negative association of five percentage points for men as well\footnote{Results available on request.}, which suggests, that there might be an selection issue into to biomarker subsample for men.

Now, when looking at the results of table \ref{tab:Objective_diabetes}, we find that the adverse association of diabetes with employment chances persists and still appears to be statistically significant as well when we use objectively measured diabetes instead, at least for the pooled sample. This would suggest, that relying on self-reported diabetes only could lead to an upward bias in the diabetes estimate. However, as discussed earlier, a diagnosis of diabetes provides the diagnosed person with information that might influence its future labour market decisions, distinguishing this person from a person with undiagnosed diabetes.  The next step in our analysis therefore estimates a model including both, diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes, together as explanatory
variables.
