\section{\label{sec:RESULTS} Results}


\subsection{Panel data analysis}

Using fixed effects, the results indicate significant and substantial
reductions in employment chances for people with self-reported diabetes
(Table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-and}). The effects themselves
differ little between males and females indicating a reduction in
employment chances by between 5 and 6 percentage points.

While the adverse relationship between self-reported diabetes and
employment chances appears to be quite strong we find no evidence
for any relationship with wages or working hours. To investigate if
there are differences in wages and working hours between different
worktypes, we estimate a model including interaction terms between
self-reported diabetes and agricultural employment and self-reported
diabetes and self-employment, using non-agricultural employment as
the base. There could be good reason for a heterogeneous relationships
of self-reported diabetes and worktype: The health consequences of
diabetes could have bigger consequences for those doing strenuous
agricultural labour compared to working in an office job.

 As Table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-interaction} shows, male
agricultural workers seem to have lower wages generally, but there
does not seem to be a strong additional relationship with diabetes
though the coefficient signs for male and female agricultural workers
are negative. The only statistically more relevant relationship we
find for working hours of agricultural workers with diabetes, who
appear to work about 6 hours less than non-agricultural workers without
self-reported diabetes. However, compared to agricultural workers
without self-reported diabetes, no significant difference can be found.
When stratified by gender, standard errors become larger, which should
be explained by the small number of observations of females with diabetes
reporting working hours in agricultural employment (n=10) compared
to men (n=139). Overall, we find no evidence for any association of
self-reported diabetes and wages or working hours.

Because diabetes is a chronic and generally life-long disease, it
is worthwhile to investigate at what points in time after the first
diagnosis diabetes might affect labour market outcomes. It could be
that the effect increases linearly over time as diabetes progresses.
However, non-linear relationships are also imaginable as psychological
effects of the immediate diagnosis as well as the likely health problems
that led to the diagnosis could affect labour market outcomes immediately
after a person had been diagnosed. They could then level off later
as people with diabetes get better at managing and living with the
disease.

We first use kernel-weighted local polynomial regression to graph
the relationship between our outcome variables and diabetes duration
to investigate the relationship. As figure \ref{fig:Kernel-weighted-local-polynomial}
shows, the relationship of diabetes duration and employment chances
seems to be more or less linear for the pooled sample showing a steady
decline, though less so when separated by gender. We find a first
decline in employment probabilities for men after about seven years
which continues to about year twenty after diagnosis. For women, a
first steep drop off occurs right after diagnosis and thereafter no
consistent pattern can be observed. However, the displayed relationships
after year twenty suffer from large standard errors as sample size
is reduced considerably. For the other two outcomes, the relationships
seem to be somewhat more erratic, especially after the first twelve
years. In an effort to best capture any non-linearities for the pooled
and gender stratifies samples, we create the following splines to
capture the immediate, intermediate and long-term relationships: 0--4,
4--11, 11--20 and 20+.
