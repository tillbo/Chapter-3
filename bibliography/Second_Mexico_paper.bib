@article{Zajacova2010,
  abstract = {Background: Many epidemiological studies rely on self-reported information, the accuracy of which is critical for unbiased estimates of population health. Previously, accuracy has been analyzed by comparing self-reports to other sources, such as cancer registries. Cancer is believed to be a well-reported condition. This paper uses novel panel data to test the consistency of cancer reports for respondents with repeated self-reports. Methods: Data come from 978 adults who reported having been diagnosed with cancer in at least one of four waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, 1999-2005. Consistency of cancer occurrence reports and precision of timing of onset were studied as a function of individual and cancer-related characteristics using logistic and ordered logistic models. Results: Almost 30\% of respondents gave inconsistent cancer reports, meaning they said they never had cancer after having said they did have cancer in a previous interview; 50\% reported the year of diagnosis with a discrepancy of two or more years. More recent cancers were reported with a higher consistency and timing precision; cervical cancer was reported more inaccurately than other cancer types. Demographic and socio-economic factors were only weak predictors of reporting quality. Conclusions: Results suggest that retrospective reports of cancer contain significant measurement error. The errors, however, are fairly random across different social groups, meaning that the results based on the data are not systematically biased by socio-economic factors. Even for health events as salient as cancer, researchers should exercise caution about the presumed accuracy of self-reports, especially if the timing of diagnosis is an important covariate.},

@article{Bell2015,
  abstract = {This article challenges the status of Fixed Effects models as the default modelling option when using time-series cross-sectional and panel data. We show that a complete understanding of the difference between within and between effects of predictor variables is important in considering what modelling strategy to use. We show that the main problem of Random Effects modelling - endogenous variables - is in fact a case of omitted variable bias that is readily solvable using a variant of the Mundlak (1978a) formulation. Consequently, Random Effects modelling provides everything that Fixed Effects modelling promises, and much more. Crucially it allows the modelling of time-invariant variables, and does so in a more parsimonious and explicit way than an alternative, Pl\"{u}mper and Troegers Fixed Effects Vector Decomposition (2007). It is also readily extendable to a Random Coefficients Model, allowing reliable, differential effects of variables without heavy parameterisation. As such we are arguing not simply for a technical solution to endogeneity, but for the substantive importance of modelling context, and the ability of Random Effects modelling to do so. Our empirical examples then show that failing to do this can lead to very misleading results. The distinctive focus of this paper is the stress on the substantive interpretation of the within and between relations. This has implications that extend beyond the realm of political science, to all datasets that have a multilevel structure.},

Using microdata from a 1994-1999 population based study of middle aged and older Mexican Americans in the Southwest, this study analyzes the impact of diabetes on the employment and earnings outcomes of adults 45 years of age and older. The empirical results from estimating maximum likelihood employment and earnings models suggest that diabetes leads to lower productivity and earnings for women but has no statistically significant impact on their employment probability. In the case of men, however, diabetes leads to a lower employment propensity but has no effect on earnings. Thus, the problems associated with this condition could lead to potential future financial difficulties particularly for high-risk populations in their later years.},

@article{Stevens2008,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rates of diseases and injuries and the effects of their risk factors can have substantial subnational heterogeneity, especially in middle-income countries like Mexico. Subnational analysis of the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors can improve characterization of the epidemiological transition and identify policy priorities. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimated deaths and loss of healthy life years (measured in disability-adjusted life years [DALYs]) in 2004 from a comprehensive list of diseases and injuries, and 16 major risk factors, by sex and age for Mexico and its states. Data sources included the vital statistics, national censuses, health examination surveys, and published epidemiological studies. Mortality statistics were adjusted for underreporting, misreporting of age at death, and for misclassification and incomparability of cause-of-death assignment. Nationally, noncommunicable diseases caused 75\% of total deaths and 68\% of total DALYs, with another 14\% of deaths and 18\% of DALYs caused by undernutrition and communicable, maternal, and perinatal diseases. The leading causes of death were ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, liver cirrhosis, and road traffic injuries. High body mass index, high blood glucose, and alcohol use were the leading risk factors for disease burden, causing 5.1\%, 5.0\%, and 7.3\% of total burden of disease, respectively. Mexico City had the lowest mortality rates (4.2 per 1,000) and the Southern region the highest (5.0 per 1,000); under-five mortality in the Southern region was nearly twice that of Mexico City. In the Southern region undernutrition and communicable, maternal, and perinatal diseases caused 23\% of DALYs; in Chiapas, they caused 29\% of DALYs. At the same time, the absolute rates of noncommunicable disease and injury burdens were highest in the Southern region (105 DALYs per 1,000 population versus 97 nationally for noncommunicable diseases; 22 versus 19 for injuries). CONCLUSIONS: Mexico is at an advanced stage in the epidemiologic transition, with the majority of the disease and injury burden from noncommunicable diseases. A unique characteristic of the epidemiological transition in Mexico is that overweight and obesity, high blood glucose, and alcohol use are responsible for larger burden of disease than other noncommunicable disease risks such as tobacco smoking. The Southern region is least advanced in the epidemiological transition and suffers from the largest burden of ill health in all disease and injury groups.},

A prominent explanation for this pattern is that physical growth and cognitive development share childhood inputs, inducing a correlation between adult height and two productive skills: strength and intelligence. This paper explores the relative roles of strength and intelligence in explaining the labor market height premium among Mexican men. While cognitive test scores account for a limited share of the height premium, roughly half of the premium can be attributed to the educational and occupational choices of taller workers. Taller workers obtain more education and sort into occupations with greater intelligence requirements and lower strength requirements, suggesting a possible role for cognitive skill. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Performing genetic studies in multiple human populations can identify disease risk alleles that are common in one population but rare in others, with the potential to illuminate pathophysiology, health disparities, and the population genetic origins of disease alleles. Here we analysed 9.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each of 8,214 Mexicans and other Latin Americans: 3,848 with type 2 diabetes and 4,366 non-diabetic controls. In addition to replicating previous findings, we identified a novel locus associated with type 2 diabetes at genome-wide significance spanning the solute carriers SLC16A11 and SLC16A13 (P = 3.9 × 10(-13); odds ratio (OR) = 1.29). The association was stronger in younger, leaner people with type 2 diabetes, and replicated in independent samples (P = 1.1 × 10(-4); OR = 1.20). The risk haplotype carries four amino acid substitutions, all in SLC16A11; it is present at \~{}50\% frequency in Native American samples and \~{}10\% in east Asian, but is rare in European and African samples. Analysis of an archaic genome sequence indicated that the risk haplotype introgressed into modern humans via admixture with Neanderthals. The SLC16A11 messenger RNA is expressed in liver, and V5-tagged SLC16A11 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression of SLC16A11 in heterologous cells alters lipid metabolism, most notably causing an increase in intracellular triacylglycerol levels. Despite type 2 diabetes having been well studied by genome-wide association studies in other populations, analysis in Mexican and Latin American individuals identified SLC16A11 as a novel candidate gene for type 2 diabetes with a possible role in triacylglycerol metabolism.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study attempted to determine factors that help currently employed people with rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus or hearing loss to continue working. METHODS: This was a qualitative study that used three concept-mapping sessions. Sixty-nine participants (rheumatoid arthritis 21, diabetes mellitus 23, and hearing loss 25) were recruited from the patient records of the rheumatology, diabetes, and audiology outpatients of the Academic Medical Center (AMC), Amsterdam, and referrals from occupational physicians and patient associations. An arthritis consultant, a diabetes consultant, and an audiologist screened the patients for the used illness inclusion criteria. A researcher screened the patients for the inclusion criteria of age and work. RESULTS: The main factors enabling employees to continue working were ability to cope with the illness, support from management and colleagues, adequate work conditions, support of patient organizations and society, support of medical professionals and facilities, and benefits. The three groups of employees rated the priority of these factors differently. For the employees with rheumatoid arthritis, the support of management was the most important, followed by self-acceptance, self-efficacy, and professional advice on how to cope at work. For those with diabetes mellitus, self-acceptance, self-care, and support from management, colleagues and health professionals were the most important. For employees with hearing loss, being well informed about hearing equipment, reimbursement, and self-acceptance were the most important. A topic list was developed that can be used by health professionals as a guideline for exploring the work-related problems of patients with a chronic disease. CONCLUSION: The results provide an understanding of the needs chronically ill employees have at work and the areas to which health professionals need to pay attention.},

After matching people with diabetes to those without the disease in terms of age, sex, and years of education, we used Cox proportional hazards analyses to estimate the effect of diabetes on time of leaving the labor force. Across the sixteen countries, people diagnosed with diabetes had a 30 percent increase in the rate of labor-force exit, compared to people without the disease.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Compared to participation rates among general populations, participation of people with chronic illness in the labour market lags behind. This is undesirable, both from the perspective of individuals' well-being as from a macro-economic perspective for western countries where concerns exist about labour supply and sustainability of social security in the near future. To help develop successful policy measures to prevent early drop-out and support reintegration, we aimed to gain insight into the role of three age related characteristics that may relate to labour participation chances of people with chronic illness: the duration of their illness, how old they were when the chronic disease was diagnosed and the historical year in which the diagnosis was established.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We analyzed data of one (first) measurement of several cohorts of people diagnosed with a somatic chronic disease, who (had) participated in the Dutch 'National Panel of people with Chronic illness or Disability' since 1998 (N = 4634 in total). Multi-level logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate random effects of the age at diagnosis and the year of diagnosis and fixed effects of illness duration on labour participation, while correcting for the effects of socio-demographic and disease characteristics and socio-economic indicators.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A significant part of the variation in labour participation among people with chronic illness relates to the age they had when they were diagnosed. Furthermore, a longer illness duration is significantly associated with a lower chance of being economically active. This is more the case for men than for women. Labour participation of cancer survivors depends on the phase of the illness they find themselves in. No evidence was found that the year in which the diagnosis was established matters for employment chances later in life.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Age at diagnosis and illness duration relate to chronically ill people's chances to participate in the labour market, but how and how strong they relate to labour participation depend on gender and the type of chronic disease at stake. Prospective studies are needed to assess illness trajectories of specific diagnostic groups along with the development of their school and work careers.},

@article{TheInteractConsortium2013,
  abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Although a family history of type 2 diabetes is a strong risk factor for the disease, the factors mediating this excess risk are poorly understood. In the InterAct case-cohort study, we investigated the association between a family history of diabetes among different family members and the incidence of type 2 diabetes, as well as the extent to which genetic, anthropometric and lifestyle risk factors mediated this association. METHODS: A total of 13,869 individuals (including 6,168 incident cases of type 2 diabetes) had family history data available, and 6,887 individuals had complete data on all mediators. Country-specific Prentice-weighted Cox models were fitted within country, and HRs were combined using random effects meta-analysis. Lifestyle and anthropometric measurements were performed at baseline, and a genetic risk score comprising 35 polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes was created. RESULTS: A family history of type 2 diabetes was associated with a higher incidence of the condition (HR 2.72, 95\% CI 2.48, 2.99). Adjustment for established risk factors including BMI and waist circumference only modestly attenuated this association (HR 2.44, 95\% CI 2.03, 2.95); the genetic score alone explained only 2\% of the family history-associated risk of type 2 diabetes. The greatest risk of type 2 diabetes was observed in those with a biparental history of type 2 diabetes (HR 5.14, 95\% CI 3.74, 7.07) and those whose parents had been diagnosed with diabetes at a younger age (<50 years; HR 4.69, 95\% CI 3.35, 6.58), an effect largely confined to a maternal family history. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Prominent lifestyle, anthropometric and genetic risk factors explained only a marginal proportion of the excess risk associated with family history, highlighting the fact that family history remains a strong, independent and easily assessed risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Discovering factors that will explain the association of family history with type 2 diabetes risk will provide important insight into the aetiology of type 2 diabetes.},

@article{Bound1995,
  abstract = {Abstract We draw attention to two problems associated with the use of instrumental variables (IV), the importance of which for empirical work has not been fully appreciated. First, the use of instruments that explain little of the variation in the endogenous explanatory variables can lead to large inconsistencies in the IV estimates even if only a weak relationship exists between the instruments and the error in the structural equation. Second, in finite samples, IV estimates are biased in the same direction as ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates. The magnitude of the bias of IV estimates approaches that of OLS estimates as the R 2 between the instruments and the endogenous explanatory variable approaches 0. To illustrate these problems, we reexamine the results of a recent paper by Angrist and Krueger, who used large samples from the U.S. Census to estimate wage equations in which quarter of birth is used as an instrument for educational attainment. We find evidence that, despite huge sample sizes, their IV estimates may suffer from finite-sample bias and may be inconsistent as well. These findings suggest that valid instruments may be more difficult to find than previously imagined. They also indicate that the use of large data sets does not necessarily insulate researchers from quantitatively important finite-sample biases. We suggest that the partial R 2 and the F statistic of the identifying instruments in the first-stage estimation are useful indicators of the quality of the IV estimates and should be routinely reported.},

The evidence on the subject has grown significantly since an earlier influential review was published in 2004. We find that in low-income countries or in countries with low human development index (HDI), the association between SES and obesity appears to be positive for both men and women: the more affluent and/or those with higher educational attainment tend to be more likely to be obese. However, in middle-income countries or in countries with medium HDI, the association becomes largely mixed for men and mainly negative for women. This particular shift appears to occur at an even lower level of per capita income than suggested by an influential earlier review. By contrast, obesity in children appears to be predominantly a problem of the rich in low- and middle-income countries.},

  abstract = {The consequences of spinal cord injury are profound and extend well beyond the immediate loss ofmobility and sensation. Employment is a well-recognised rehabilitation goal. In this study, we examine the impact of a publicly funded package of services that is designed to enable people with a spinal cord injury to return to the workplace. Specifically, this package of services provided client directed assistance for assisting the recipient with the activities of daily living (e.g., bathing, food preparation, etc.).Wecombine primary data collection methods well developed in other scientific disciplines, but less frequently utilised within economics, with traditional econometric techniques, to present a novel approach to this methodological issue. The Spinal Injuries Survey Instrument was developed and administered using amatched sampling approach. Collected data included, labour market outcomes, exposure to the packages, as well as clinical and demographic covariates commonly identified by the spinal cord injury literature. Concern for endogeneity was addressed by collecting data on several variables that might serve as suitable instruments for the econometric work and measures of otherwise-unobserved sources of heterogeneity. For example, a psychological measure of attributional style was adapted from the field of psychology in order to control for a potentially confounding source of latent individual heterogeneity, viz.  motivation. While our results find zero marginal effect of support packages on labour market outcomes, we find that training undertaken post-injury and age are both positively correlated with labour market participation. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, the first to our knowledge, summarizing and quantifying the published evidence on associations between type 2 diabetes incidence and socio-economic position (SEP) (measured by educational level, occupation and income) worldwide and when sub-divided into high-, middle- and low-income countries. METHODS: Relevant case-control and cohort studies published between 1966 and January 2010 were searched in PubMed and EMBASE using the keywords: diabetes vs educational level, occupation or income. All identified citations were screened by one author, and two authors independently evaluated and extracted data from relevant publications. Risk estimates from individual studies were pooled using random-effects models quantifying the associations. RESULTS: Out of 5120 citations, 23 studies, including 41 measures of association, were found to be relevant. Compared with high educational level, occupation and income, low levels of these determinants were associated with an overall increased risk of type 2 diabetes; [relative risk (RR) = 1.41, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.28-1.51], (RR = 1.31, 95\% CI: 1.09-1.57) and (RR = 1.40, 95\% CI: 1.04-1.88), respectively. The increased risks were independent of the income levels of countries, although based on limited data in middle- and low-income countries. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of getting type 2 diabetes was associated with low SEP in high-, middle- and low-income countries and overall. The strength of the associations was consistent in high-income countries, whereas there is a strong need for further investigation in middle- and low-income countries.},

We therefore did a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the strength of association between these conditions and the effect of factors that might modify the risk. METHODS: We identified cohort studies in which women who had developed type 2 diabetes after gestational diabetes were followed up between Jan 1, 1960, and Jan 31, 2009, from Embase and Medline. 205 relevant reports were hand searched. We selected 20 studies that included 675 455 women and 10 859 type 2 diabetic events. We calculated and pooled unadjusted relative risks (RRs) with 95\% CIs for each study using a random-effects model. Subgroups analysed were the number of cases of type 2 diabetes, ethnic origin, duration of follow-up, maternal age, body-mass index, and diagnostic criteria. FINDINGS: Women with gestational diabetes had an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with those who had a normoglycaemic pregnancy (RR 7.43, 95\% CI 4.79-11.51). Although the largest study (659 164 women; 9502 cases of type 2 diabetes) had the largest RR (12.6, 95\% CI 12.15-13.19), RRs were generally consistent among the subgroups assessed. INTERPRETATION: Increased awareness of the magnitude and timing of the risk of type 2 diabetes after gestational diabetes among patients and clinicians could provide an opportunity to test and use dietary, lifestyle, and pharmacological interventions that might prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in affected women.

@book{Sicree2009,
  abstract = {Diabetes is now one of the most common non-communicable diseases globally. It is the fourth or fifth leading cause of death in most high-income countries and there is substantial evidence that it is epidemic in many low- and middle-income countries. Complications from diabetes, such as coronary artery and peripheral vascular disease, stroke, diabetic neuropathy, amputations, renal failure and blindness are resulting in increasing disability, reduced life expectancy and enormous health costs for virtually every society. Diabetes is certain to be one of the most challenging health problems in the 21st century. The number of studies describing the epidemiology of diabetes over the last 20 years has been extraordinary. It is now recognized that it is the developing countries that presently face the greatest burden of diabetes. However, many governments and public health planners still remain largely unaware of the current magnitude, or, more importantly, the future potential for increases in diabetes and its serious complications in their own countries. In addition to diabetes, the condition of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) also constitutes a major public health problem, both because of its association with diabetes incidence and its own association with an increased risk of the development of cardiovascular disease. The data presented in this report should be cautiously interpreted as general indicators of diabetes frequency, and the estimates will need to be revised as new and better epidemiological information becomes available. When reporting data in this form, various assumptions need to be made that give rise to a number of limitations. Caution should be used when interpreting data and their limitations will be discussed further throughout the text. Comparison of country, regional, and even global rates from one report to the next can be misleading and should be performed with extreme caution. Large changes in the prevalence or numbers of people with diabetes from one edition of the Diabetes Atlas to another are usually due to the use of a more recent study rather than a genuine change in the profile of diabetes within that country. Thus, the inclusion of recent, and more reliable research brings us closer to the actual rates of diabetes, but also brings with it dangers in comparing global reports and estimates over time. These limitations need to always be considered, and the reader must realize that the key purpose of reports such as these is to stimulate action in the form of preventive and management programmes, as well as further research.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subjects were classified as previously diagnosed T2D (PD); or as finding of the survey (FS) (glucose >or=126 mg/dL). Hemoglobin A1c was measured in PD-subjects. RESULTS: The prevalence for PD-T2D was 7.34\% (95\%CI 6.3, 8.5) and for FS 7.07\% (95\%CI 6.1, 8.1), summing 14.42\%; (7.3 million diabetics). 5.3\% of PD-T2D were in good, 38.4\% in poor and 56.2\% very poor control. Older age (OR=0.96, 95\%CI 0.94, 0.97), lower BMI (OR=0.95, 95\%CI 0.91, 1.0), were protective for poor control. Affiliation to private services (OR=1.77, 95\%CI 0.98, 3.13), larger T2D duration (OR=1.05, 95\%CI 1.01, 1.08), and combining oral medication and insulin (OR=16.1, 95\%CI 1.61, 161) were riskier. CONCLUSIONS: We found an alarming prevalence of T2D in Mexican population; the majority of PD diabetics are in poor control. Research on the latter is warranted.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to characterise the epidemiological and nutritional transition and their determinants in Mexico. DESIGN: Age-adjusted standardised mortality rates (SMRs) due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), diabetes mellitus and hypertension were calculated for 1980-1998. Changes in the prevalences of overweight and obesity in women and children and of dietary intake from 1988 to 1999 were also used in the analysis. Quantities of food groups purchased by adult equivalent (AE) and food expenditures away from home between 1984 and 1989 were used to assess trends. All information was analysed at the national and regional levels, and by urban and rural areas. RESULTS: SMR for diabetes, AMI and hypertension increased dramatically parallel to obesity at the national and regional levels. Fat intake in women and the purchase of refined carbohydrates, including soda, also increased. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that obesity is playing a role in the increased SMRs of diabetes, AMI and hypertension in Mexico. Total energy dietary intake and food purchase data could not explain the rise in the prevalence of obesity. The increases in fat intake and the purchase of refined carbohydrates may be risk factors for increased mortality. Information on physical activity was not available. CONCLUSION: SMRs due to diabetes, hypertension and AMI have increased dramatically in parallel with the prevalence of obesity; therefore actions should be taken for the prevention of obesity. Reliable information about food consumption and physical activity is required to assess their specific roles in the aetiology of obesity.},

  abstract = {Mexico is reaching universal health coverage in 2012. A national health insurance programme called Seguro Popular, introduced in 2003, is providing access to a package of comprehensive health services with financial protection for more than 50 million Mexicans previously excluded from insurance. Universal coverage in Mexico is synonymous with social protection of health. This report analyses the road to universal coverage along three dimensions of protection: against health risks, for patients through quality assurance of health care, and against the financial consequences of disease and injury. We present a conceptual discussion of the transition from labour-based social security to social protection of health, which implies access to effective health care as a universal right based on citizenship, the ethical basis of the Mexican reform. We discuss the conditions that prompted the reform, as well as its design and inception, and we describe the 9-year, evidence-driven implementation process, including updates and improvements to the original programme. The core of the report concentrates on the effects and impacts of the reform, based on analysis of all published and publically available scientific literature and new data. Evidence indicates that Seguro Popular is improving access to health services and reducing the prevalence of catastrophic and impoverishing health expenditures, especially for the poor. Recent studies also show improvement in effective coverage. This research then addresses persistent challenges, including the need to translate financial resources into more effective, equitable and responsive health services. A next generation of reforms will be required and these include systemic measures to complete the reorganisation of the health system by functions. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the Mexican quest to achieve universal health coverage and its relevance for other low-income and middle-income countries.},

At follow-up 8-10 years later, T2D was diagnosed in 60 women and 111 men. Work stress factors evaluated by questionnaire (i.e., demands, decision latitude, job strain, shift work, overtime work, and also sense of coherence) were studied in association with T2D. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% CIs adjusted for age, education, BMI, physical activity, smoking, family history of diabetes, and psychological distress were calculated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In women, low decision latitude was associated with T2D on its own (OR 2.4 [95\% CI 1.1-5.2]) and combined with high demands: job strain (OR 4.2 [2.0-8.7]), adjusted for all available potential confounders. Also, shift work increased the risk of T2D in women (OR 2.2 [1.0-4.7]) when adjusted for age, education, and psychological distress, although this risk was diluted after multifactor adjustment (OR 1.9 [0.8-4.4]). In men, high work demands and high strain decreased the risk of T2D (OR 0.5 [0.3-0.9]) for both measures, as did an active job (high demands and high decision latitude, OR 0.4 [0.2-0.9]).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Work stress and shift work may contribute to the development of T2D in women.

This report does not invalidate the 2006 recommendations on the use of plasma glucose measurements to diagnose diabetes.  A WHO expert consultation was held from 28 to 30 March 2009.  A systematic review was conducted on the use of HbA1c as a diagnostic test for diabetes mellitus. The evidence was summarized and its quality evaluated using the GRADE methodology. The recommendation was formulated and its strength was rated on a two-point scale, based on the quality of evidence and the applicability and performance of the method in different settings.  The WHO Consultation concluded that HbA1c can be used as a diagnostic test for diabetes, provided that stringent quality assurance tests are in place and assays are standardised to criteria aligned to the international reference values, and there are no conditions present which preclude its accurate measurement.  An HbA1c of 6.5\% is recommended as the cut point for diagnosing diabetes.  A value less than 6.5\% does not exclude diabetes diagnosed using glucose tests. The expert group concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to make any formal recommendation on the interpretation of HbA1c levels below 6.5\%. GRADE quality of evidence: moderate GRADE strength of recommendation: conditional},

@article{Vijan2004,
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Diabetes is a highly prevalent condition that results in substantial morbidity and premature mortality. We investigated how diabetes-associated mortality, disability, early retirement, and work absenteeism impacts workforce participation. DATA SOURCE: We used the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a national household sample of adults aged 51-61 in 1992, as a data source. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted cross-sectional analyses on the baseline HRS data, and longitudinal analyses using data from eight years of follow-up. We used two-part regression models to estimate the adjusted impact of diabetes on workforce participation, and then estimated the economic impact of diabetes-related losses in productivity. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Diabetes is a significant predictor of lost productivity. The incremental lost income due to diabetes by 1992 was 60.0 billion US dollars over an average diabetes duration of 9.7 years. From 1992 to 2000, diabetes was responsible for 4.4 billion US dollars in lost income due to early retirement, 0.5 billion US dollars due to increased sick days, 31.7 billion US dollars due to disability, and 22.0 US dollars billion in lost income due to premature mortality, for a total of 58.6 billion dollars in lost productivity, or 7.3 billion US dollars per year. CONCLUSIONS: In the U.S. population of adults born between 1931 and 1941, diabetes is associated with a profound negative impact on economic productivity. By 1992, an estimated 60 billion US dollars in lost productivity was associated with diabetes; additional annual losses averaged 7.3 billion US dollars over the next eight years, totaling about 120 billion US dollars by the year 2000. Given the rising prevalence of diabetes, these costs are likely to increase substantially unless countered by better public health or medical interventions.},

  abstract = {In empirical analysis of data consisting of repeated observations on economic units (time series on a cross section) it is often assumed that the coefficients of the quantitative variables (slopes) are the same, whereas the coefficients of the qualitative variables (intercepts or effects) vary over units or periods.This is the constant-slope variable-intercept framework. In such an analysis an explicit account should be taken of the statistical dependence that exists between the quantitative variables and the effects. It is shown that when this is done, the random effect approach and the fixed effect approach yield the same estimate for the slopes, the within estimate. Any matrix combination of the within and between estimates is generally biased. When the within estimate is subject to a relatively large error a minimum mean square error can be applied, as is generally done in regression analysis. Such an estimator is developed here from a somewhat different point of departure.},

@article{Howe2008,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies often require measures of socio-economic position (SEP). The application of principal components analysis (PCA) to data on asset-ownership is one popular approach to household SEP measurement. Proponents suggest that the approach provides a rational method for weighting asset data in a single indicator, captures the most important aspect of SEP for health studies, and is based on data that are readily available and/or simple to collect. However, the use of PCA on asset data may not be the best approach to SEP measurement. There remains concern that this approach can obscure the meaning of the final index and is statistically inappropriate for use with discrete data. In addition, the choice of assets to include and the level of agreement between wealth indices and more conventional measures of SEP such as consumption expenditure remain unclear. We discuss these issues, illustrating our examples with data from the Malawi Integrated Household Survey 2004-5. METHODS: Wealth indices were constructed using the assets on which data are collected within Demographic and Health Surveys. Indices were constructed using five weighting methods: PCA, PCA using dichotomised versions of categorical variables, equal weights, weights equal to the inverse of the proportion of households owning the item, and Multiple Correspondence Analysis. Agreement between indices was assessed. Indices were compared with per capita consumption expenditure, and the difference in agreement assessed when different methods were used to adjust consumption expenditure for household size and composition. RESULTS: All indices demonstrated similarly modest agreement with consumption expenditure. The indices constructed using dichotomised data showed strong agreement with each other, as did the indices constructed using categorical data. Agreement was lower between indices using data coded in different ways. The level of agreement between wealth indices and consumption expenditure did not differ when different consumption equivalence scales were applied. CONCLUSION: This study questions the appropriateness of wealth indices as proxies for consumption expenditure. The choice of data included had a greater influence on the wealth index than the method used to weight the data. Despite the limitations of PCA, alternative methods also all had disadvantages.},

Further, health behaviors, such as exercise, smoking, drinking, as well as weight status, are instrumental to diabetes management and the reduction of its medical consequences. Nine waves of the Health and Retirement Study are used to model the role of a recent diabetes diagnosis and medication on present and subsequent weight status, exercise, drinking, and smoking activity. Several non-linear dynamic population average probit models are estimated. Results suggest that compared to non-diagnosed individuals at risk for high blood sugar, diagnosed diabetics respond initially in terms of increasing exercise, losing weight, and curbing smoking and drinking behavior, but the effect diminishes after diagnosis. Evidence of recidivism is also found in these outcomes, especially weight status and physical activity, suggesting that some behavioral responses to diabetes may be short-lived.},

  abstract = {The main objective was to identify economic burden from epidemiological changes and expected demand for health care services for diabetes in M\'{e}xico. The cost evaluation method to estimate direct and indirect costs was based on instrumentation and consensus techniques. To estimate the epidemiological changes for 2009-2011, three probabilistic models were constructed according to the Box-Jenkins technique. Comparing the economic impact in 2009 versus 2011 (p< 0.05), there is a 33\% increase in financial requirements. The total amount for diabetes in 2010 (US dollars) will be \$778,427,475. It includes \$343,226,541 in direct costs and \$435,200,934 in indirect costs. The total direct costs expected are: \$40,787,547 for the Ministry of Health (SSA), serving to uninsured population; \$113,664,454 for insured population (Mexican Institute for Social Security-IMSS-, and Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers-ISSSTE-); \$178,477,754 to users; and \$10,296,786 to Private Health Insurance (PHI). Conclusions: If the risk factors and the different health care models remain as they are currently in the institutions analyzed, the financial consequences would be of major impact for the pockets of the users, following in order of importance, social security institutions and finally Ministry of Health. Allocate more resources to promotion and prevention of diabetes will decrease the cost increase by decreasing the demand for treatment of complications.},

  abstract = {Type 2 diabetes is a global public health crisis that threatens the economies of all nations, particularly developing countries. Fueled by rapid urbanization, nutrition transition, and increasingly sedentary lifestyles, the epidemic has grown in parallel with the worldwide rise in obesity. Asia's large population and rapid economic development have made it an epicenter of the epidemic. Asian populations tend to develop diabetes at younger ages and lower BMI levels than Caucasians. Several factors contribute to accelerated diabetes epidemic in Asians, including the normal-weight metabolically obese phenotype; high prevalence of smoking and heavy alcohol use; high intake of refined carbohydrates (e.g., white rice); and dramatically decreased physical activity levels. Poor nutrition in utero and in early life combined with overnutrition in later life may also play a role in Asia's diabetes epidemic. Recent advances in genome-wide association studies have contributed substantially to our understanding of diabetes pathophysiology, but currently identified genetic loci are insufficient to explain ethnic differences in diabetes risk. Nonetheless, interactions between Westernized diet and lifestyle and genetic background may accelerate the growth of diabetes in the context of rapid nutrition transition. Epidemiologic studies and randomized clinical trials show that type 2 diabetes is largely preventable through diet and lifestyle modifications. Translating these findings into practice, however, requires fundamental changes in public policies, the food and built environments, and health systems. To curb the escalating diabetes epidemic, primary prevention through promotion of a healthy diet and lifestyle should be a global public policy priority.},

  abstract = {Job loss in the United States is associated with long-term reductions in income and long-term increases in mortality rates. This paper examines the short- to medium-term changes in health, health care access, and health care utilization after job loss that lead to these long-term effects. Using a sample with more than 9800 individual job losses and longitudinal data on a wide variety of health-related measures and outcomes, we show that job loss results in worse self-reported health, including mental health, but is not associated with statistically significant increases in a variety of specific chronic conditions. Among the full sample of workers, we see reductions in insurance coverage, but little evidence of reductions in health care utilization after job loss. Among the subset of displaced workers for whom the lost job was their primary source of insurance we do see reductions in doctor’s visits and prescription drug usage. These results suggest that access to health insurance and care may be an important part of the health effects of job loss for some workers. The pattern of results is also consistent with a significant role for stress in generating long-term health consequences after job loss.},

Using data from three panel waves of the Border Epidemiologic Study on Aging, collected between 1995 and 2003, estimation results from a set of logit regression models reveal that obese individuals, who lose weight over an eight-year period, are less likely to be diagnosed with diabetes than those who remain obese in waves two and three. Moreover, employment, an important covariate in all three waves, is associated with the lower likelihood of being diagnosed with diabetes. In all, results confirm findings from cross-sectional data that point to overweight and obesity as important predictors of diabetes and further support public policy efforts that aim at controlling the rising incidence of diabetes through tailored interventions.},

  abstract = {Are there negative health effects from losing the job? We analyze the causal effect of job displacement on diabetes incidence and prevalence. Type 2 diabetes is an illness that is directly affected by lifestyle factors and psychosocial stress, and with severe side-effects deteriorating the quality of life. We use rich Swedish register data that allows us to identify workers displaced through plant downsizing between 2002 and 2004, matched to detailed information on diabetes status from the Swedish National Diabetes Register. As those displaced at large layoffs may still be a selective group with respect to health we match them to comparable workers not being displaced. On average we do not find signs for a significant increase in the diabetes onset in case an individual is mass-laid off. However, we find substantial effect heterogeneity when distinguishing between different socio-economic characteristics which additionally differ between men and women. For example, the probability of the onset of diabetes increases due to being mass laid off in case men do not have a partner. In addition there are signs that women in case of having a partner and a child below 18 also suffer in terms of diabetes incidence in case they are mass-laid off.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to characterize familial risks for type 2 diabetes by the type and number of affected family members, including half-siblings, adoptees, and spouses, to quantify risks and estimate the contribution of environmental effect. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Families were identified from the Multigeneration Register, and type 2 diabetic patients were obtained from the Hospital Discharge Register. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for offspring with type 2 diabetes whose family members were hospitalized for type 2 diabetes at ages >39 years compared with those lacking affected family members. RESULTS: The number of hospitalized type 2 diabetic patients was 157,549. Among 27,895 offspring, 27.9\% had a parent or sibling also hospitalized for type 2 diabetes. The familial relative risk (RR) ranged from 2.0 to >30, depending on the number and type of probands. The highest RRs of type 2 diabetes were found in individuals who had at least two siblings affected by type 2 diabetes, irrespective of the parental disease. Adoptees showed no risk from adopted parents. CONCLUSIONS: The study, the largest yet published, showed that familial RRs varied by the number and type of affected family member. However, much of the familial clustering remains yet to be genetically explained. The high risk should be recognized in clinical genetic counseling. The data from adoptees confirmed the genetic basis of the familial associations, but those from half siblings and spouses suggested that a smaller part of familial clustering may be accounted for by environmental factors.},

An endogenous multivariate probit model is used to account for the potential endogeneity of the incidence of chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and mental illnesses. The cross-equation correlations are significant, rejecting the exogeneity of the chronic illnesses. Marginal effects of exogenous socio-demographic and lifestyle variables are estimated through their direct effects on labour market participation and indirect effects via the chronic diseases. The treatment effects of chronic diseases on labour force participation are estimated via conditional probabilities using five-dimensional normal distributions. The estimated effects differ by gender and age groups. Although computationally more demanding, these treatment effects are compared with results from a univariate model treating the chronic conditions exogenous and the structural effects from the multivariate probit model; both significantly overestimate the effects.},

Findings indicate that diabetes, estimated wholly, is significantly detrimental to most labor market outcomes. However, separation of type I and II diabetes shows that much of the negative effect is due to type II diabetes. On average a female with type II diabetes can experience a wage penalty of almost 50\% relative to a healthy individual. Additionally, estimates of specifically type II diabetes may be subject to endogeneity bias. To account for this, I utilize whether an individual's biological mother has been diagnosed with diabetes as an instrumental variable. This instrument provides both theoretical and statistical explanatory power to separate the causal effect of type II diabetes on labor-force decisions.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To test the validity of proxy measures of household wealth and income that can be readily implemented in health surveys in rural Africa. DESIGN: Data are drawn from four different integrated household surveys. The assumptions underlying the choice of wealth proxy are described, and correlations with the true value are assessed in two different settings. The expenditure proxy is developed and then tested for replicability in two independent datasets representing the same population. SETTING: Rural areas of Mali, Malawi, and C\^{o}te d'Ivoire (two national surveys). PARTICIPANTS: Random sample of rural households in each setting (n=275, 707, 910, and 856, respectively). MAIN RESULTS: In both Mali and Malawi, the wealth proxy correlated highly (r>/=0.74) with the more complex monetary value method. For rural areas of C\^{o}te d'Ivoire, it was possible to generate a list of just 10 expenditure items, the values of which when summed correlated highly with expenditures on all items combined (r=0.74, development dataset, r=0. 72, validation dataset). Total household expenditure is an accepted alternative to household income in developing country settings. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to approximate both household wealth and expenditures in rural African settings without dramatically lengthening questionnaires that have a primary focus on health outcomes.},

@phdthesis{Nava-Ledezma2010a,
  abstract = {Diabetes is a significant health problem in Mexico and one of the leading causes of death. Studies in other countries have suggested that socioeconomic status (SES) contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes. However, only few studies in Mexico have dealt with SES differentials in diabetes. The aim of this thesis is to examine the association between SES and type 2 diabetes among Mexican adults aged 20-69. In contrast with previous studies, we use individual, household and municipality measures of SES simultaneously when investigating: prevalence of total, diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes in the year 2000; and incidence of diagnosed diabetes during the period 2002-2005. Furthermore, we explore the effects of diabetes on employment status, and changes in waist circumference (WC) among adults with diabetes. Data were used from the 2000 National Health Survey (NHS-2000) and the Mexican Family Life Surveys 2002 and 2005 (MxFLS-2002 and MxFLS-2005). Diabetes was defined using self-reports (in both surveys) and outcomes from capillary blood tests (only in the NHS). SES was measured through educational attainment, household income, household wealth and municipality deprivation. The index of household wealth was calculated and evaluated using the National Survey of Household Income and Expenditure (ENIGH-2000). The Human Development Index (HDI) and the Deprivation Index (DI) at the municipality level are official statistics obtained from the 2000 Mexican Census of population. Two level logistic regression models were estimated, and the analyses were stratified mainly by sex, urban/rural stratum and municipality deprivation. Our findings confirm an association between socioeconomic status and diabetes. However, this relationship varies by SES measure, sex, urbanisation and deprivation. A consistent result was that diabetes was more common among the less educated, in the least deprived municipalities, and in urbanised localities. Variations in diabetes between municipalities were better explained by genetic, biological and lifestyle factors, than by SES. Diabetes was associated with working status, but not with employment status or changes in WC. Increases in urbanisation and further socioeconomic development, in combination with increased life expectancy, will lead to a higher prevalence of diabetes particularly among the most vulnerable groups. In addition to the promotion of healthy behaviours in the overall Mexican population, health sustainability should be prioritized in those communities at early stages of the nutritional and epidemiological transition. ii},

Using data from the National Population Health Survey (1998), it utilizes a recursive bivariate probit approach to take into account the potential endogeneity of diabetes in employment outcomes. The results suggest that treating diabetes as exogenous yields an over-estimation of its impact on male employment. The study finds that diabetes has a significant negative impact on female employment probability, but has no significant impact on that of non-white Canadians. An implication thus is that policy-makers should take endogeneity into account in estimating labor market costs of chronic diseases such as diabetes.},

  abstract = {ivreg2h estimates an instrumental variables regression model providing the option to generate instruments using Lewbel's (J.Bus.Ec.Stat., 2012) method. This technique allows the identification of structural parameters in regression models with endogenous or mismeasured regressors in the absence of traditional identifying information, such as external instruments or repeated measurements. Identification is achieved in this context by having regressors that are uncorrelated with the product of heteroskedastic errors, which is a feature of many models where error correlations are due to an unobserved common factor. Using this form of Lewbel's method, instruments may be constructed as simple functions of the model's data. This approach may thus be applied when no external instruments are available, or, alternatively, used to supplement external instruments to improve the efficiency of the IV estimator. Supplementing external instruments can also allow Sargan-Hansen tests of the orthogonality conditions or overidentifying restrictions to be performed, which would not be available in the case of exact identification by external instruments. The routine will work with ivreg29 (for version 9) or ivreg28 (for version 8.2) if one of those packages is installed.},

  abstract = {While experimental and observational studies suggest that sugar intake is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes, independent of its role in obesity, it is unclear whether alterations in sugar intake can account for differences in diabetes prevalence among overall populations. Using econometric models of repeated cross-sectional data on diabetes and nutritional components of food from 175 countries, we found that every 150 kcal/person/day increase in sugar availability (about one can of soda/day) was associated with increased diabetes prevalence by 1.1\% (p <0.001) after testing for potential selection biases and controlling for other food types (including fibers, meats, fruits, oils, cereals), total calories, overweight and obesity, period-effects, and several socioeconomic variables such as aging, urbanization and income. No other food types yielded significant individual associations with diabetes prevalence after controlling for obesity and other confounders. The impact of sugar on diabetes was independent of sedentary behavior and alcohol use, and the effect was modified but not confounded by obesity or overweight. Duration and degree of sugar exposure correlated significantly with diabetes prevalence in a dose-dependent manner, while declines in sugar exposure correlated with significant subsequent declines in diabetes rates independently of other socioeconomic, dietary and obesity prevalence changes. Differences in sugar availability statistically explain variations in diabetes prevalence rates at a population level that are not explained by physical activity, overweight or obesity.},

  abstract = {Little is understood about the patterns and trends in adolescent and adult beverage intake in Mexico or most other countries. Here, we used nationally representative dietary intake, income, and food expenditure surveys, which included 416 adolescents (aged 12-18 y) and 2180 adults (aged >or=19 y) from the 1999 Mexican Nutrition Survey and 7464 adolescents and 21,113 adults from the 2006 Mexican Health and Nutrition Survey. We measured the volume and energy per day contributed by all beverages consumed by the sample subjects. In 2006, Mexican adolescents and adults obtained 20.1 and 22.3\%, respectively, of their energy intake from energy-containing beverages. Whole milk, carbonated and noncarbonated sugar-sweetened beverages, fruit juice with various sugar and water combinations added, and alcohol represented the 4 major categories of beverage intake. The trends from the dietary intake surveys showed very large increases in the intake of energy-containing beverages among adolescents and adults between 1999 and 2006. Income elasticities showed a high likelihood that intakes will increase as Mexican incomes continue to rise. Whereas the own-price elasticities for whole milk and sodas were both modest, intakes of these were increasing and higher than those for all other food groups. Energy intake trends and current levels of beverage intakes in Mexico are the highest recorded in a nationally representative survey and present major challenges for public health authorities.},

Several countries are now facing a double burden of malnutrition, i.e. caloric (energy) and micronutrient deficiencies and, at the same time, obesity and diet-related chronic diseases. This nutrition transition is associated with rapid economic development, urbanization and global changes, which lead to shifts towards a more energy dense diet, including more fat and sugar and more processed foods, and at the same time dramatic alterations in physical activity patterns and lifestyles. While infectious diseases and maternal and child undernutrition continue to take an enormous toll in lives and health worldwide, the rapid rise of NCDs represents one of the major health challenges to global development in the twenty-first century and threatens economic and social development of nations as well as the lives and health of millions globally. This publication explores the situation of the double burden of malnutrition in six geographically and culturally diverse case study countries and presents conclusions and recommendations from a follow-up workshop with the case study authors.},

@article{Yu2007,
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in aboriginal populations worldwide. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Medline search from 1966 to 2005 was conducted. Studies were selected if they utilized accepted diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes. Year of study, sample size, response rate, age range, and prevalence of type 2 diabetes and IGT were documented. RESULTS: Forty-two studies were selected, comprising 59 populations. Although the majority demonstrated a several-fold elevation of type 2 diabetes prevalence as compared to non-aboriginal populations, this was not a universal finding; a small number of populations studied actually had a low prevalence of type 2 diabetes and IGT. Lower prevalences were found in rural compared with urban populations. Interestingly, we were also able to document an inverse relationship between the ratio of IGT/type 2 diabetes and type 2 diabetes prevalence. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that those populations with the very highest rates of type 2 diabetes appear to have progressed past the prediabetes stages in the natural history of this metabolic disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetes and IGT prevalence rates vary widely amongst the world's aboriginal populations. Despite very different histories and cultures, the consequences of rapid changes in nutrition and exercise appear to have very similar metabolic consequences on aboriginal populations, the magnitude of which may be determined by the strength of the genetic susceptibility.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mexico has been experiencing some of the most rapid shifts ever recorded in dietary and physical activity patterns leading to obesity. Diabetes mellitus has played a crucial role causing nearly 14\% of all deaths. We wanted to make a comprehensive study of the role of diabetes in terms of burden of disease, prevalence, cost of diabetes, cost of complications and health policy. METHOD: We review the quantitative data that provides evidence of the extent to which the Mexican health economy is affected by the disease and its complications. We then discuss the current situation of diabetes in Mexico with experts in the field. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the prevalence of diabetes from 1994 to 2006 with rising direct costs (2006: outpatient USD\$ 717,764,787, inpatient USD\$ 223,581,099) and indirect costs (2005: USD\$ 177,220,390), and rising costs of complications (2010: Retinopathy USD\$ 10,323,421; Cardiovascular disease USD\$ 12,843,134; Nephropathy USD\$ 81,814,501; Neuropathy USD\$ 2,760,271; Peripheral vascular disease USD\$ 2,042,601). The health policy focused on screening and the creation of self-support groups across the country. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing diabetes mortality and lack of control among diagnosed patients make quality of treatment a major concern in Mexico. The growing prevalence of childhood and adult obesity and the metabolic syndrome suggest that the situation could be even worse in the coming years. The government has reacted strongly with national actions to address the growing burden posed by diabetes. However our research suggests that the prevalence and mortality of diabetes will continue to rise in the future.},

Among exposed Muslims the share of males is lower, which is most likely caused by death before birth.

@article{BrownIII2011,
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether labor market effects were the result of diabetes per se or rather depended on the degree to which diabetes was controlled through management of blood sugar levels. METHODS This study utilized data from a recently completed survey of households in Brownsville, Texas, a largely Mexican American community with a high prevalence of diabetes that is located on the Texas-Mexico border. Diabetes management, or control, was measured by blood sugar levels, glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) levels, and interaction terms. Methods used were probit and Heckman regression. RESULTS Management of diabetes did not appear to have a discernible impact on labor market outcomes in the short run. However, diabetes was negatively associated with male productivity, particularly in males' propensity to work. The new American Diabetes Association (ADA) definition of diabetes is based on having an A1C level of <6.5\%. Using the new ADA definition, diabetes was negatively associated with female productivity. Female productivity was also negatively associated with the new ADA definition of prediabetes (A1C levels between 5.7\% and 6.4\%). However, very few people with diabetes actually controlled their blood sugar or A1C levels. CONCLUSION These results imply that in order to avoid productivity losses associated with diabetes, more scarce prevention resources should be spent on prevention of the onset of diabetes than on the management of A1C for those already diagnosed with diabetes. For women, the prevention of prediabetes is key.},

@article{Samb2010,
  abstract = {National health systems need strengthening if they are to meet the growing challenge of chronic diseases in low-income and middle-income countries. By application of an accepted health-systems framework to the evidence, we report that the factors that limit countries' capacity to implement proven strategies for chronic diseases relate to the way in which health systems are designed and function. Substantial constraints are apparent across each of the six key health-systems components of health financing, governance, health workforce, health information, medical products and technologies, and health-service delivery. These constraints have become more evident as development partners have accelerated efforts to respond to HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, and vaccine-preventable diseases. A new global agenda for health-systems strengthening is arising from the urgent need to scale up and sustain these priority interventions. Most chronic diseases are neglected in this dialogue about health systems, despite the fact that non-communicable diseases (most of which are chronic) will account for 69\% of all global deaths by 2030 with 80\% of these deaths in low-income and middle-income countries. At the same time, advocates for action against chronic diseases are not paying enough attention to health systems as part of an effective response. Efforts to scale up interventions for management of common chronic diseases in these countries tend to focus on one disease and its causes, and are often fragmented and vertical. Evidence is emerging that chronic disease interventions could contribute to strengthening the capacity of health systems to deliver a comprehensive range of services-provided that such investments are planned to include these broad objectives. Because effective chronic disease programmes are highly dependent on well-functioning national health systems, chronic diseases should be a litmus test for health-systems strengthening.},

  abstract = {Recent research has reported that habitually short sleep duration is a risk factor for declining health, including increased risk of obesity, diabetes and coronary heart disease. In this study we investigate whether macroeconomic conditions are associated with variation in mean sleep time in the United States, and if so, whether the effect is procyclical or countercyclical. We merge state unemployment rates from 2003 through 2012 with the American Time Use Survey, a nationally representative sample of adults with 24h time diaries. We find that higher aggregate unemployment is associated with longer mean sleep duration, with each additional point of state unemployment associated with an additional average 0.83min of sleep (p<0.001), after adjusting for a secular trend of increasing sleep over the time period. Despite a national poll in 2009 that found one-third of Americans reporting losing sleep over the economy, we do not find that higher state unemployment is associated with more sleeplessness. Instead, we find that higher state unemployment is associated with less frequent time use described as sleeplessness (marginal effect=0.05 at 4\% unemployment and 0.034 at 14\% unemployment, p<0.001), after controlling for a secular trend.},

Since the activities of county departments of public health are likely to affect mortality rates with a lag, Koyck distributed lag models are estimated using the Lewbel instrumental variables estimator. The findings show that an additional \$10 per capita of public health expenditures reduces all-cause mortality by 9.1 deaths per 100,000. At current funding levels, the long-run annual number of lives saved by the presence of county departments of public health in California is estimated to be approximately 27,000 (26,937 lives, 95\% confidence interval: [11,963, 41,911]). The annual value of these lives is estimated to be worth \$212.8 billion using inflation-adjusted standard U.S. government estimates of the value of a statistical life (\$7.9 million).},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: The frequency of remission of type 2 diabetes achievable with lifestyle intervention is unclear.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To examine the association of a long-term intensive weight-loss intervention with the frequency of remission from type 2 diabetes to prediabetes or normoglycemia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Ancillary observational analysis of a 4-year randomized controlled trial (baseline visit, August 2001-April 2004; last follow-up, April 2008) comparing an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) with a diabetes support and education control condition (DSE) among 4503 US adults with body mass index of 25 or higher and type 2 diabetes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive the ILI, which included weekly group and individual counseling in the first 6 months followed by 3 sessions per month for the second 6 months and twice-monthly contact and regular refresher group series and campaigns in years 2 to 4 (n=2241) or the DSE, which was an offer of 3 group sessions per year on diet, physical activity, and social support (n=2262).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Partial or complete remission of diabetes, defined as transition from meeting diabetes criteria to a prediabetes or nondiabetic level of glycemia (fasting plasma glucose <126 mg/dL and hemoglobin A1c <6.5\% with no antihyperglycemic medication). RESULTS Intensive lifestyle intervention participants lost significantly more weight than DSE participants at year 1 (net difference, -7.9\%; 95\% CI, -8.3\% to -7.6\%) and at year 4 (-3.9\%; 95\% CI, -4.4\% to -3.5\%) and had greater fitness increases at year 1 (net difference, 15.4\%; 95\% CI, 13.7\%-17.0\%) and at year 4 (6.4\%; 95\% CI, 4.7\%-8.1\%) (P < .001 for each). The ILI group was significantly more likely to experience any remission (partial or complete), with prevalences of 11.5\% (95\% CI, 10.1\%-12.8\%) during the first year and 7.3\% (95\% CI, 6.2\%-8.4\%) at year 4, compared with 2.0\% for the DSE group at both time points (95\% CIs, 1.4\%-2.6\% at year 1 and 1.5\%-2.7\% at year 4) (P < .001 for each). Among ILI participants, 9.2\% (95\% CI, 7.9\%-10.4\%), 6.4\% (95\% CI, 5.3\%-7.4\%), and 3.5\% (95\% CI, 2.7\%-4.3\%) had continuous, sustained remission for at least 2, at least 3, and 4 years, respectively, compared with less than 2\% of DSE participants (1.7\% [95\% CI, 1.2\%-2.3\%] for at least 2 years; 1.3\% [95\% CI, 0.8\%-1.7\%] for at least 3 years; and 0.5\% [95\% CI, 0.2\%-0.8\%] for 4 years).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In these exploratory analyses of overweight adults, an intensive lifestyle intervention was associated with a greater likelihood of partial remission of type 2 diabetes compared with diabetes support and education.

@article{Huxley2006,
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the relative risk for fatal coronary heart disease associated with diabetes in men and women. DESIGN: Meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. DATA SOURCES: Studies published between 1966 and March 2005, identified through Embase and Medline, using a combined text word and MESH heading search strategy, in addition to studies from the Asia Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration. REVIEW METHODS: Studies were eligible if they had reported estimates of the relative risk for fatal coronary heart disease comparing men and women with and without diabetes. Studies were excluded if the estimates were not adjusted at least for age. RESULTS: 37 studies of type 2 diabetes and fatal coronary heart disease among a total of 447,064 patients were identified. The rate of fatal coronary heart disease was higher in patients with diabetes than in those without (5.4 v 1.6\%). The overall summary relative risk for fatal coronary heart disease in patients with diabetes compared with no diabetes was significantly greater among women than it was among men: 3.50, 95\% confidence interval 2.70 to 4.53 v 2.06, 1.81 to 2.34. After exclusion of the eight studies that had adjusted only for age, the difference in risk between the sexes was substantially reduced but still highly significant. The pooled ratio of the relative risks (women: men) from the 29 studies with multiple adjusted estimates was 1.46 (1.14 to 1.88). CONCLUSIONS: The relative risk for fatal coronary heart disease associated with diabetes is 50\% higher in women than it is in men. This greater excess coronary risk may be explained by more adverse cardiovascular risk profiles among women with diabetes, combined with possible disparities in treatment that favour men.},

The results suggest that both the probability of employment and wages are negatively related to the number of years since the initial diagnosis of diabetes. Moreover, the effect of diabetes duration on the probability of employment appears to be nonlinear, peaking around 16 years for females and 10 years for males. A similar negative effect on wages is found only in male diabetics. Finally, the results suggest that failure to distinguish between type I and type II diabetics may lead to some counterintuitive results.},
