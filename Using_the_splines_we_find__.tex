Using the splines, we find that for the pooled sample employment chances
are reduced for those reporting a diagnosis more than eleven years
ago, with each additional year reducing employment chances by about
two percentage points (Table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-duration-splines-1}).
When stratified into males and females, the signs still indicate a
negative association, albeit much weaker. Interestingly, using splines
we find a relatively strong reduction of wages 4-11 years after diagnosis
particularly for the pooled sample. No important associations are
found for diabetes duration and working hours.\footnote{To specifically account for the binary nature of employment, all employment
models have also been estimated using a population-averaged panel-data
model with the probit link function. To account for fixed unobserved
heterogeneity a specification proposed by \citet{Bell2015} is used
which itself draws from \citet{Mundlak1978}. \citet{Mundlak1978}
showed that including group means for each time varying explanatory
variable additionally to the normal covariates it is possible to capture
the time invariant component of the variable, instead of restricting
analysis to the within variation as in the fixed effects model. Doing
this allows to control for any unobserved time-invariant confounders
just as in the fixed-effects model. This approach has been further
advanced by \citet{Bell2015} to differentiate clearly between the
within and the between effects of the used variables. They suggest
demeaning the individual observation from the group mean and including
it in the model instead of the full observation. We use this strategy
because it allows the estimation of a population-averaged panel-data
model using the probit link function in the panel context while accounting
for fixed unobserved heterogeneity \citep{Dieleman2014}. Using this
strategy has yielded qualitatively similar results to those of the
linear fixed effects specifications and the results are available
on request.}
