Diabetes, and particularly its most common variant, type 2 diabetes, has increased worldwide and is expected to continue to rise over the next decades \parencite{Risk2016}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{It }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The condition }\DIFaddend has become a problem for \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \ac{MICs} %%%
\DIFdel{and }%DIFDELCMD < \acp{HIC} %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{middle-income countries and high-income countries }\DIFaddend alike, with over two-thirds of people with diabetes living in the developing world \parencite{InternationalDiabetesFederation2013}. Mexicans and Mexican-Americans appear to be particularly affected by diabetes, also in comparison to other Latino populations living in the \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \ac{USA} %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{USA }\DIFaddend \parencite{Schneiderman2014}. In Mexico itself, diabetes prevalence has been estimated to have grown from 6.7\% in 1994 to 14.4\% in 2006, including both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases \parencite{Barquera2013}, and is expected to increase further over the next decades \parencite{Meza2015}. Already now, diabetes is the number one cause of death in Mexico \parencite{Barquera2013}. 

The observed trend has been attributed to a deterioration in diet and a reduction in physical activity \parencite{Barquera2008b,Basu2013}, while genetic predisposition among Mexicans with pre-hispanic ancestry may also \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{have played }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{play }\DIFaddend a role \parencite{Williams2013}. Recent evidence indicates that the onset of diabetes has been occurring at an ever earlier age in Mexico \parencite{Villalpando2010}. With treatment as ineffective as it currently \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is ---only }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is---only }\DIFaddend a minority achieves adequate blood glucose control \parencite{Barquera2013}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{--- the earlier onset }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{---the earlier start }\DIFaddend will increase the likelihood of complications during the productive lifespan. 

Diabetes is a term used to describe various conditions characterized by high blood glucose values, with the predominant disease being type 2 diabetes accounting for about 90\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{percent }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \% \DIFaddend of all diabetes cases \parencite{Sicree2009}. The elevated
blood glucose levels that are a result of the body's inability to use insulin properly to maintain blood glucose at normal levels, can entail a range of adverse health effects for the individual concerned. However, via effective self-management of the disease much if not all of the complications can be avoided \parencite{Lim2011, Gregg2012}. In the absence of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{effective self-management ---or }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{this management---or }\DIFaddend in the case of inadequate \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{treatment--- diabetes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{treatment---diabetes }\DIFaddend has been documented to lead to conditions such as heart disease and stroke, blindness, kidney problems, and nerve problems which together with impaired wound healing can lead to the loss of limbs \parencite{Reynoso-Noveron2011}. These conditions can be seriously debilitating and may therefore reduce an individual's economic activity, including its productivity and labor market participation.

The effect of diabetes on labor \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{market }\DIFdelend outcomes has been studied predominantly in \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \acp{HIC} %%%
\DIFdel{---with the exception of a study on Mexico }%DIFDELCMD < \autocite{Seuring2015} %%%
\DIFdel{and one on China }%DIFDELCMD < \parencite{Liu2014} %%%
\DIFdel{each. In the }%DIFDELCMD < \ac{HIC} %%%
\DIFdel{studies }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{high-income countries where }\DIFaddend diabetes has been found to be associated with reductions in employment probabilities as well as wages and labor supply \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \parencite{Brown2005,Brown2014,BrownIII2011,Minor2010,Minor2013,Minor2015,Latif2009,Seuring2015a}%%%
\DIFdel{.}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \parencite{Brown2005,Brown2014,BrownIII2011,Minor2011,Minor2013,Minor2015,Latif2009,Seuring2015a}\DIFadd{.}\footnote{\DIFadd{We know of only two studies for middle income countries, one for Mexico }\parencite{Seuring2015} \DIFadd{and one for China }\parencite{Liu2014}\DIFadd{, which are discussed later in more detail.}}
\DIFaddend 

While these studies have provided useful evidence \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on the potential labor market effects of diabetes}\DIFdelend , many of the complexities of the relationship \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{have not been comprehensively addressed in any given study. First of all, unobserved }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{between diabetes and labor outcomes remain have remained unaddressed. Unobserved }\DIFaddend heterogeneity presents a challenge \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to estimate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{when estimating }\DIFaddend the relationship between diabetes and labor outcomes. Especially time-invariant unobserved individual characteristics, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{e.g. health endowments ---often related to health during uteru, infant and child years, and to low household income or adverse health shocks during these early years--- }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{like health endowments , }\DIFaddend as well as risk preferences have been shown to adversely affect health in general and the propensity to develop type 2 diabetes more specifically \parencite{VanEwijk2011,Sotomayor2013,Li2010b}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. These and other unobserved personal characteristics (e.g. ability) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; they }\DIFaddend may also affect employment probabilities, wages or working \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{hours }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{hours---either }\DIFaddend directly through their effects on contemporaneous productivity \parencite{Currie2013} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{or }\DIFaddend indirectly by limiting educational attainment and human capital accumulation \parencite{Ayyagari2011a}. Further, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{only focusing on the overall effect of a self-reported diabetes diagnosis does not reveal }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{given the chronic nature of the condition, it would be of interest to better understand }\DIFaddend when potential labor market penalties appear, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{given the dynamic aspect of diabetes and the potential differences in its effects }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and how these effects change }\DIFaddend over time. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Additionally, apart from its health impact diabetesmight also affect labor market outcomes through other channels. For instance, people }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{Finally, given that most studies rely on self-reported diabetes data, it is of interest to contrast estimates obtained from this data with those yielded from clinical test data on diabetes. Especially in a middle income country setting, where large parts of the population remain undiagnosed, this can reveal hidden impacts, namely for those who are unaware of the disease. Diabetes may also have an effect in itself. People }\DIFaddend aware of their condition may\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, for instance, }\DIFaddend be less inclined to continue working if this interferes with their disease management\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{or }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, they may }\DIFaddend be suffering from psychological \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{consequences (depression, anxiety) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{stress, depression, or anxiety, because }\DIFaddend of becoming aware of the disease; they may also use the diagnosis as a justification for decreasing their labor supply \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, leading to a potential justification bias in the estimated effect of diabetes }\DIFdelend \parencite{Kapteyn2009}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Importantly, for these reasons the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{As a consequence }\DIFaddend labor market effects may \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{also }\DIFdelend be distinct for people with self-reported versus those unaware of their condition, potentially leading to biased estimates if the analysis is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{solely }\DIFdelend based on self-reports \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{alone}\DIFaddend .

The objective of this study is to provide new evidence on the impact of diabetes on labor outcomes, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{while improving }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and improve }\DIFaddend upon previous work by paying close attention to the above challenges. We use three waves of panel data from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Mexico }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\acf{MxFLS}\DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend covering the period 2002--2012\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, provided by the }%DIFDELCMD < \ac{MxFLS}%%%
\DIFdelend . The \ac{MxFLS} is particularly useful for the analysis of diabetes as it allows \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{us to account }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{accounting }\DIFaddend for the above complexities in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a more refined way than has been the case so far}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{more refined ways than existing studies}\DIFaddend . Using individual level \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \ac{FE} %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \acf{FE} \DIFaddend analysis for the first time in this literature, we take account of time-invariant heterogeneity when assessing the impact of self-reported diabetes and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{self-reported diabetes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{its }\DIFaddend duration on labor \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{market outcomes.}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{outcomes.}\DIFaddend \footnote{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We are not aware }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A recent review }\DIFaddend of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{any other evidence on }\DIFdelend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{effect on wages }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{economic cost of diabetes confirms the scarcity of evidence for low- }\DIFaddend and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{working hours in a }%DIFDELCMD < \ac{MIC}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{middle-income countries }\parencite{Seuring2015a}\DIFaddend .}  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Further, we add to the current literature in exploring the role of undiagnosed diabetes, using }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Using }\DIFaddend novel and rich biomarker data \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{- an }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{we also explore the role of undiagnosed diabetes---an }\DIFaddend issue of considerable importance in light of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the large prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{its high prevalence }\DIFaddend (see \textcite{Beagley2014}) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and because it has }\DIFaddend remained unaccounted for in most earlier studies\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend which typically rely on self-reported information. Doing so sheds light on the issue of measurement error and the potentially differential effects of self-reported and undiagnosed diabetes.

Our results using self-reported diabetes suggest an economically important decrease in the employment probability of people aware of their disease. Wages and working hours, however, do not appear to be \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{negatively associated }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{lower for those }\DIFaddend with self-reported diabetes. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We further find }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A dynamic analysis indicates }\DIFaddend that employment probabilities are reduced \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{gradually }\DIFaddend with each additional year since diagnosis, with some evidence for an even larger effect per year after the initial 10 years.

The biomarker analysis indicates that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{self-reported }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{clinically diagnosed }\DIFaddend diabetes entails a significant employment penalty \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, while biometrically measured diabetes does not . Overall, undiagnosed diabetes does not appear to affect any of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for women but not for men. Assessing the effects of both clinical and self-reported diabetes at the same time provides an insight into }\DIFaddend the labor market \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{outcomes examined here, suggesting that adverse effects mainly occur to those }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{impact for those with undiagnosed diabetes---people who are tested positive but did not self-report. The results suggest that }\DIFaddend self-reporting \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a diagnosis. We argue that , nonetheless, the effects found for self-reported diabetes in this study are largely unbiased as long as inference is not extended to the unobserved undiagnosed population, and are economically important in light of the sheer size of the diagnosed population in Mexico.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in itself has a negative and significant effect for men, but the effect is not statistically significant for women, possibly  due to large standard errors. In contrast we find no evidence for an effect of undiagnosed diabetes.

This pattern is confirmed in our data where only a tiny proportion of the respondents reports to have diabetes while having biomarker results below the diabetes threshold.

However, a much larger proportion misreports to not have diabetes (18}\%\DIFadd{). The key concern thus lies with false negatives, as people may either have forgotten that they have been diagnosed with the condition, or have never been diagnosed.

\DIFadd{Mexico is a middle-income country with among the highest prevalences of obesity and diabetes in the world }\parencite{InternationalDiabetesFederation2015,WHO}\DIFadd{. A recent study showed that diabetes accounted for one-third of all deaths in a large sample of Mexicans 35 to 74 years of age in Mexico City, with renal disease, cardiac disease, infection, acute diabetic crisis, and other vascular diseases being the biggest contributors to the elevated mortality risk of people with diabetes }\parencite{Alegre-Diaz2016}\DIFadd{. The high disease burden of diabetes coexist with high levels of infectious diseases in Mexico, exposing the health system to a 'double-disease burden' that increases the pressure to identify treatment priorities and to efficiently use the existing resources, with the treatment of non-communicable diseases not being well integrated in the health care system }\parencite{Gutierrez-delgado2009}\DIFadd{. Earlier studies point to an underwhelming performance of the health system in diagnosing and effectively treating diabetes in Mexico, with most persons with diabetes achieving only poor glucose control and suffering from other untreated risk factors such as hypertension }\parencite{Alegre-Diaz2016,Flores-Hernandez2015,Barquera2013}\DIFadd{. Additionally, about half of the diabetes population has been estimated to be unaware of the condition }\parencite{Barquera2013}\DIFadd{.
}

\DIFadd{This paper uses }\DIFaddend the \acf{MxFLS}, a nationally representative, longitudinal household survey \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend which has three waves conducted in 2002, 2005--2006 and 2009--2012. All household members aged 15 and above were interviewed, covering information on a wide range of social, demographic, economic and health characteristics of the individuals and their families \parencite{Rubalcava2013}. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Throughout the analysis the samples we use are restricted to the working age population (15--64). Our first part of the analysis uses all three waves, taking advantage of the large amount of observations and the panel structure of the data. The second part uses a biomarker subsample of the third wave (2009---2012). It is important to note that this sample is somewhat older on average, as it includes everybody above the age of 44 but only a random subsample of those aged 44 or below }\parencite{Crimmins2015}\DIFadd{. This also leads to self-reported diabetes being higher for this subsample. The biomarker analysis will therefore be compared for this subsample specifically.
}

\DIFadd{The analysis focuses on the labor outcomes employment, hourly wage and weekly working hour, as well as occupation.}\footnote{\DIFadd{Employment status is defined as having worked or carried out an activity that helped with the household expenses the last week and working for at least four hours per week. We explicitly include those employed informally, for instance people working in a family business. We tested if changing the definition of being employed to having worked at least ten hours per week, and this only leads to marginal changes in the coefficients and standard errors, not affecting the interpretation of the results. Hourly wage was calculated by adding up the reported monthly income from the first and second job (if any) and dividing it by the average number of weeks per month providing us with an estimate of the average earnings per week, which is then divided by the weekly working hours to arrive at the hourly wage.  labor income was reported in two ways: either responding to questions on wages, income from piecework, tips, income from extra hours, meals, housing, transport, medical benefits and other earnings, or by reporting the aggregate labor income for the whole month. We adjusted the calculated wage for inflation from the year of the interview up to 2013 and consider the log of real wages.  Due to a considerable number of missing or zero income reports, the sample used for the wage estimation is smaller than the sample for working hours. Working hours reflect working hours of the first and second job (if applicable).}}  \DIFadd{About half of the respondents in the sample live in rural areas. Looking at our outcome variables, 86}\% \DIFadd{of men report some form of employment compared to 37}\% \DIFadd{of women. Interestingly, men do not report considerably higher hourly wages than women but work more hours per week. Also, men are working more often in agricultural jobs while women are more likely to be self-employed or in non-agricultural wage employment. Women also have lower educational attainment on average (see Table \ref{tab:Pooled-sample-characteristics}).
}

 


\DIFadd{In the first part of the analysis we focus on the relationship of labor outcomes with self-reported diabetes }\footnote{\DIFadd{Self-reported diabetes is based on the survey question: “Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?”}}\DIFadd{, following the dominant approach in the literature. For the pooled data of all three waves (Table \ref{tab:Pooled-sample-characteristics}), diabetes was self-reported by 5}\% \DIFadd{of men and 6}\% \DIFadd{of women, respectively. This is consistent with \textcite{Barquera2013} who observe a prevalence of diagnosed diabetes in Mexico of 7.5}\% \DIFadd{in 2006, using a slightly older sample that also included elderly above the age of 64. }\DIFaddend Apart from self-reported diabetes information that is available in all rounds, we also use information on the self-reported year of diagnosis as well as biomarker data including \ac{HbA1c} levels for a subsample of respondents. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Our main analysis uses all three waves taking advantage of the large amount of observations and the panel structure of the data.Our variable of interest is self-reported diabetes}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{Because self-reported diabetes reporting inhibited some inconsistency over time for some of the respondents, we tried to increase the consistency by using disease information from earlier and ensuing waves to infer on the current, missing or inconsistent, diabetes status. Appendix 1 provides details on the applied correction procedures. An further, and no less important, source of measurement error with self-reported diabetes is the omission of those with undiagnosed diabetes, i.e the false negatives. In order to investigate how this may affect estimates of the labor market impact of diabetes, we use information from a subsample of the 2009-2012 wave containing over 6000 respondents (everybody aged 45+ and a random subsample of those aged 15–44 (Crimmins et al.}\DIFaddend , \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{which is based on the survey question: "Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes ?"}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2015)) that have biometrically measured blood glucose values, allowing for the identification of those with undiagnosed diabetes. Throughout, our analysis focuses on the working age population (15–64), and excludes pregnant women and those in school.}\footnote{\DIFadd{Pregnant women have an increased diabetes risk and this may bias the estimated impact of diabetes on female employment status. We dropped all observations of women reporting to be pregnant at the time of the survey (N=764).}} \DIFadd{Apart from self-reported diabetes information available in all waves, we also use information on the self-reported year of diagnosis---available in the third wave---to construct a measure of the time since diagnosis for all waves. Importantly, this limits the sample of the time since diagnosis analysis to those that were present in the third wave}\DIFaddend .

In order to investigate how this may affect estimates of the labor market impact of diabetes we use information from a subsample of the 2009-2012 wave containing over 6000 respondents (everybody aged 45+  and a random subsample of those aged 15--44 }%DIFDELCMD < \parencite{Crimmins2015}%%%

L=L(H, pc, w(H;S,A,B,I,\alpha,e_{w}), S, A, B, V, \xi) \label{eq:wage}

\DIFdel{where $L$ is labor supply or labor market participation, $pc $ is a vector of prices for consumer goods, $w$ is the real wage; $H$ is an array of measured health status ; $S$ is education; $A$ is a vector of demographic characteristics; $B$ is the family background of the individual; $I$ captures the local community infrastructure; $\alpha$ is an array of unobservables (e.g. ability), $e_w$ represents the measurement error, $V$ is non-labor income and $\xi$ is the taste parameter. 
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{The equation showcases the joint effect of health on both wages and labor supply or labor market participation. Health affects labor supply and participation directly by impacting the ability to work and indirectly by changing wages.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{There are several ways diabetes may affect $H$. First of all, diabetes can deteriorate health if it remains untreated, with the adverse effects potentially increasing over time. Second, a diagnosis of diabetes and ensuing treatment may lead to better health compared to the undiagnosed state. However, compared to healthy people even those receiving treatment for their diabetes may still have worse health outcomes. Third, there is also evidence that the diagnosisitself may affect one's own health perception and could lead to worse self-perceived health }%DIFDELCMD < \parencite{Thoolen2006}%%%
\DIFdel{. We therefore expect diabetes to adversely affect health and consequently labor market outcomes.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{When estimating Eq. \ref{eq:wage} empirically with observational data, unobserved heterogeneity may bias the results. As mentioned in section  \ref{sec:Introduction} unobserved factors captured in $\alpha$ such as early childhood investments, innate ability and risk preference could affect wages as well as the probability to develop diabetes. Further, changes in lifestyle due to changes in wages or employment status may also affect the probability to develop diabetes through changes in diet and physical activity. Finally, measurement error $e_w$ may be an important issue due to the large undiagnosed population with diabetes, particularly if being diagnosed is related to employment or wages via better access to healthcare through employment benefits and higher income.

For the relationship of self-reported diabetes with wages and working hours our empirical models are estimated conditional on \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{having positive wages and being employed, respectively.

The control variables in both \ac{FE} specifications include dummy variables to capture the effects of the living environment, of living in a small, medium or large city with rural as the reference category, and state dummies.

principal component analysis of multiple indicators of household assets and housing conditions to create an indicator for household wealth \DIFdelbegin \footnote{\DIFdel{Our composite wealth index consists of owning a vehicle, a second house, a washing machine, dryer, stove, refrigerator or furniture, any electric appliances, any domestic appliances, a bicycle or farm animals.

However, while stress levels may change over time, a person\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{’}\DIFaddend s coping mechanisms to deal with stress are likely time-invariant \parencite{Schneiderman2005}. While we cannot exclude \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the role of these time variant }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a role of time-variant }\DIFaddend unobserved factors, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{it seems that the role of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{there seems to be consensus that }\DIFaddend time-invariant variables, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{e.g. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{including }\DIFaddend genetic predisposition and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{relatively }\DIFdelend stable personality traits, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is predominant.

\subsection{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Self-reported diabetes duration}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Labor outcomes and time since diagnosis}\DIFaddend }
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To explore the role of the duration of diabetesfor labor outcomes, we }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{Given the chronic nature and irreversibility of diabetes, it is of interest to look at the dynamic effects after diagnosis.  We }\DIFaddend estimate the following model \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{using a self-reported
measure of the years since diagnosis}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with years since self-reported diagnosis as the right hand side variable}\DIFaddend :

\begin{equation}
Y_{it}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Dyears_{it}+\beta_{2}X_{it}+c_{i}+u_{it},\label{eq:duration_linear}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\beta_{1}Dyears_{it}$ is a continuous variable indicating years since first \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{reported }\DIFaddend diabetes diagnosis. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{In an effort to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{To }\DIFaddend capture possible non-linearities in the relationship \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of interest }\DIFdelend we then use a spline function that allows for the effect of an additional year with diabetes to vary over time.
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend \begin{equation}
Y_{it}=\delta_{0}+g(Dyears_{it})+\delta_{2}X_{it}+c_{i}+u_{it}.\label{eq:splines}
\end{equation}

We choose three nodes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that ---based on visual inspection (see Figures \ref{fig:Kernel-weighted-local-polynomial_empl}, \ref{fig:Kernel-weighted-local-polynomial_wage} and \ref{fig:Kernel-weighted-local-polynomial_workhrs} in Section \ref{sec:duration})--- best }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that---based on visual inspection---best }\DIFaddend captured any possible non-linearity in the

These are located at 4, 11 and 20 years after diagnosis. The first four years should capture any immediate effects of the diagnosis, the years five to eleven should capture any effects of adaptation to the disease. After 11 years it is conceivable that many of the debilitating complications of diabetes would appear that could deteriorate health and lead to adverse effects on labor \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{market }\DIFdelend outcomes. The coefficient $\delta_{n}$ captures the effect of diabetes for the $n$-th interval. The effects are linear if $\delta_{1}=\delta_{2}=,\ldots,=\delta_{n}$.\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{Because the year of diagnosis was only reported in the third wave, duration of diabetes (or time since diagnosis) for the earlier waves was only calculated for those that had also been interviewed in the third wave, reducing the comparability of the results to those using the binary diabetes indicator.}\footnote{\DIFdel{To obtain the time passed since diagnosis, the year of diagnosis was subtracted from the year of the interview.}}

Self-reported diabetes only captures part of the diabetes population as many individuals remain undiagnosed; it may also contain cases of people who misreport having diabetes.  Estimations based on self-reports may therefore \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{suffer from selection bias in at least three ways:
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < \begin{enumerate}
%DIFDELCMD < \item %%%
\DIFdel{Systematic overreporting of diabetes: people without diabetes

\DIFdel{Systematic underreporting of diabetes: people with diabetes may also underreportbecause they are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, like being unemployed.

Furthermore, diabetes often remains undiagnosed}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{or, more importantly, diabetes has remained undiagnosed, }\DIFaddend leaving people unaware of their condition. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \item %%%
\DIFdel{Diagnosis }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Third, a diagnosis }\DIFaddend is more likely \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to happen }\DIFaddend for those who are more likely to have visited a doctor, for instance because they are more affected by the condition, wealthier, or hypochondriac. \DIFdelbegin \footnote{\DIFdel{More formally, assume that the true model of the effect of diabetes on labor market outcomes is $y^=X^{*}\beta+\epsilon$.

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{As a result, self-reports may suffer from a selection bias.
}\DIFaddend 

Overreporting may attenuate the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{effect }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{estimated impact }\DIFaddend of diabetes if \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{those falsely reporting a diabetes diagnosis }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the false positives }\DIFaddend are in fact in good health\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; it may also lead to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, or it may lead to an }\DIFaddend overestimation of the impact if \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{some of those misreports reflect other factors }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{they have other attributes }\DIFaddend that negatively affect labor outcomes\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(e.g. other illnesses or general ill health), or if they are used to justify other adverse events that may negatively affect labor outcomes}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, like general health, or another illness}\DIFaddend . Similarly, underreporting may lead to \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an }\DIFaddend overestimation if those with undiagnosed diabetes are generally healthier, hence more likely to have positive labor \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{market }\DIFdelend outcomes than those with self-reported diabetes. However, if the undiagnosed and the diagnosed groups are similar in terms of health, then this would lead to an underestimation of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{effect }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{impact }\DIFaddend of diabetes. 

The health information \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{received }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{revealed }\DIFaddend at a diabetes diagnosis may also have an effect in itself. It may for instance affect \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{an individual}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the patient}\DIFaddend 's psychology which in turn may \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{influence economic behavior}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{affect his or her economic decision making and behaviour}\DIFaddend . Two studies found \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{evidence that patients with }\DIFaddend a diabetes diagnosis and subsequent treatment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to increase the odds of psychological problems}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are more prone to psychological conditions}\DIFaddend , including depression and anxiety \parencite{Thoolen2006,Paddison2011} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, while similar results have not been found for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{compared to people without diabetes. Given that }\DIFaddend people with undiagnosed diabetes \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are not more prone to exhibit psychological conditions, this may point towards a causal relationship with the diagnosis and subsequent treatment }\DIFaddend \parencite{Nouwen2011}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Looking at behavioral change, health information has been shown to affect behavior after the diagnosis of not only diabetes}%DIFDELCMD < \parencite{Slade2012} %%%

The biomarker data }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and labor outcomes; it }\DIFaddend also enables us to look at diabetes severity, as measured by \ac{HbA1c} values. Since \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{this data is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{these data are }\DIFaddend only available for a subsample of one \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{wave ---the most recent one--- our }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{wave---the most recent one---our }\DIFaddend analysis here is limited to cross-sectional data no longer directly comparable to the panel-based results \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in this paper. Nonetheless, it allows for a first exploration of the relationships of measured diabetes and disease severity with labor market outcomes}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{reported earlier}\DIFaddend .

Our analysis of the biomarker sample consists of three steps. We first \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{estimate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{re-estimate }\DIFaddend Eq. \ref{eq:diab_sr} to assess the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{association of self reported }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{relationship between self-reported }\DIFaddend diabetes with labor outcomes, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as before, }\DIFdelend but this time for the biomarker sample only, using the following specification:
\begin{equation}
Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Dsr_{i}+\beta_{2}X_{i}+c_{i}+u_{i}\label{eq:diab_sr}
\end{equation}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{where $c_{i}$ are community fixed effects which reflect community characteristics such as access to healthcare, poverty and unemployment in the community. These factors are included as they potentially affect the propensity to develop diabetes, receive a diagnosis, and the labor outcomes of the individuals in the community.}\footnote{\DIFadd{We did not include household fixed effects since the average number of observations per household was close to one, as most households had only one member providing biomarker information.}}

\DIFadd{In a second step we }\DIFaddend then estimate the relations between diabetes, as defined by our biomarker, and labor outcomes, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{via }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{using }\DIFaddend the following equation:

\begin{equation}
Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Dbio_{i}+\beta_{2}X_{i}+c_{i}+u_{i}\label{eq:diab}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{,
}\DIFaddend \end{equation}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Here }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{where }\DIFaddend $Dbio_{i}$ is equal to $1$ if \ac{HbA1c} $\geq6.5\%$. 

To find the effect of undiagnosed diabetes we \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{then }\DIFaddend include both variables at the same time and estimate:

\begin{equation}
Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Dsr_{i}+\beta_{2}Dbio_{i}+\beta_{3}X_{i}+\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{v}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{c}\DIFaddend _{i}+u_{i}.\label{eq:diab_ud}
\end{equation}


\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For the biomarker analysis we rely on within-household variation $v_{i}$ for identification to account for unobserved community characteristics, such as the access to healthcare and the quality of healthcare in the community, poverty and unemployment levels in the community or the amount of public green space and recreational possibilities available. These factors potentially affect both the propensity to develop diabetes and to receive a diagnosis; they may also be related to labor market outcomes.}\footnote{\DIFdel{We did not account for fixed household characteristics as the average number of observations per household was close to one, i.e. for most households only one member provided biomarker information in our subsample, significantly limiting the variation within households that would be needed for identification.}}

\subsection{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Incidence of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Labor outcomes and }\DIFaddend self-reported diabetes}

Table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-and} presents the estimation results of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }%DIFDELCMD < \ac{FE} %%%
\DIFdel{model using Eq. \ref{eq:employed}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Eq. \ref{eq:cha4_employed}}\DIFaddend , which indicate significant and substantial reductions in the probability of employment for men and women with self-reported diabetes. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{effects are surprisingly similar across }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{coefficients are similar for }\DIFaddend both sexes, showing a reduction in employment probabilities of over 5 \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \ac{p.p.}%%%
\DIFdel{. }%DIFDELCMD < \begin{table}[h]
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{percentage points. In relative terms---taking into account the lower employment rates for women compared to men---these absolute reductions translate into a relative reductions in employment probabilities of 14}\% \DIFadd{for women and of 6}\% \DIFadd{for men, suggesting a stronger impact of diabetes on women than men.
}

\DIFadd{The results in Columns 3--6 of Table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-and} show no significant relationship between self-reported diabetes and wages or working hours. To assess whether this relationship differs by the type of work, as those  with diabetes working in an agricultural job that requires strenuous, physical efforts may see their productivity more adversely affected than those engaged in more sedentary work, we then include interaction terms between self-reported diabetes and agricultural employment, and between self-reported diabetes and self-employment, respectively, using non-agricultural wage employment as the comparison group, and restricting our sample to those employed only. 
}

\DIFadd{The results in Table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-interaction} show that while male agricultural workers have lower wages in general, the relationship with diabetes does not depend on the type of work, as none of the interaction terms show up as significant. In the working hours regression one interaction term is significant, suggesting that those with self-reported diabetes working in agriculture supply 5 hours less relative to non-agricultural workers and employees. However, because we have more than two work types we cannot draw conclusions
solely on the basis of the t-statistic. Using a Wald test to assess the overall significance of the interaction term, we cannot  reject the null of no interaction effects ($p = .15$).
}

\DIFadd{In summary, we find no evidence for an association between self-reported diabetes and wages or working hours. One possible explanation is that this stems from selection, as those with 'mild' or asymptomatic diabetes are more likely to remain in their job and continue to earn the same wage. Only once complications become increasingly severe would they switch activity (or drop out of the labor market), without going through a notable phase of reduced productivity and labor supply.
}

\DIFadd{To assess whether diabetes affects the selection into different types of work we proceed by estimating a similar }\ac{FE} \DIFadd{model, applied to the individual probability of being in non-agricultural wage employment, agricultural employment or self-employment, respectively, using a dummy variable indicating the respective type of work as left hand side variable. The results in Table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-selection_LPM} indicate a negative association with self-employment, though the estimates have quite large standard errors. For women, those who self-report diabetes are less likely to work in agriculture and potentially self-employment, indicating that having diabetes drives women out of self-employment and agricultural jobs, possibly because these jobs are physically more demanding or because they provide less protection in terms of health and income insurance.}\footnote{\DIFadd{We prefer this model to a multinomial logit because it allows full control of fixed effects, and results that are straight forward to interpret. As a robustness check we also estimated a multinomial logit model that includes means of time-varying covariates to proxy for fixed effects (see \textcite{Mundlak1978,Bell2015}) }\parencite{Bell2015}\DIFadd{, based on the work of \textcite{Mundlak1978}. The results indicate a very similar pattern both in size and significance.}}

\subsection{\label{sec:duration}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Duration of self-reported  diabetes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Labor outcomes and time since diagnosis}\DIFaddend }

Because diabetes is a chronic and generally life-long disease, we investigate how soon after the first diagnosis diabetes may affect labor \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{market }\DIFdelend outcomes. Given that complications of diabetes develop over time, the effect may increase linearly as the years go by. Non-linear relationships are also plausible: health problems that have led to the diagnosis\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend as well as psychological effects after the diagnosis may affect labor \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{market }\DIFdelend outcomes immediately after having been diagnosed with diabetes. Similarly\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend management of the disease may be successful only after some initial period. It is also possible that \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{complications appear }\DIFaddend after some time\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{complications start to appear, again reducing healthand leading to reductions in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, reducing health, }\DIFaddend labor supply and productivity.


To obtain an initial idea of the relationship between our outcome variables and diabetes duration we use a non-parametric kernel-weighted local polynomial regression.

For men we find no consistent effect. The results of the non-linear specification in panel B of Table \ref{tab:Self-reported-diabetes-duration_wage} indicate that there may be a reduction in wages 5--11 years after the initial diagnosis for both men and women. We also find associations for women with more than 20 years of diabetes, but these estimates may be spurious due to the considerably reduced number of observations in this group.}\footnote{\DIFadd{There are only 9 and 3 observations for male and female wages with more than 20 years since diagnosis in wave 3, respectively, and 17 and 7 in the pooled sample, respectively.

However, the non-linear results we presented are not directly comparable to these estimates as Minor used pooled cross-sectional data, constructed dummy variables instead of splines and used different duration groups.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{As discussed earlier, differences in effects between self-reported diabetes and those undiagnosed are likely to stem }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{To explore whether this stems }\DIFaddend from selection into the diagnosed population \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, for instance those in worse health or }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of those with a more severe diabetes---proxied by }\DIFaddend higher \ac{HbA1c} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{levels are more likely to go to the doctor and be diagnosed as well as to lose their job because of their diabetes . To further explore }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{levels---and a therefore higher risk to lose their job,  we test whether those with self-reported diabetes have higher levels of }\ac{HbA1c} \DIFadd{than those who were not diagnosed, using a t-test, and find that they do.}\footnote{\DIFadd{Men: Self-reported diabetes }\ac{HbA1c} \DIFadd{of 9.0}\% \DIFadd{vs 8.5}\% \DIFadd{in those undiagnosed (p < 0.01); Women: Self-reported diabetes }\ac{HbA1c} \DIFadd{of 8.9}\% \DIFadd{vs 8.7}\% \DIFadd{in those undiagnosed (p < 0.05).}} \DIFadd{We then extend the model to take into account the severity of diabetes more explicitly, using the measured HbA1c levels. If current severity would be related to labour outcomes and explain the difference in effects of self-reported and undiagnosed diabetes, one would expect (i) that those with higher }\ac{HbA1c} \DIFadd{levels have lower probability of employment, and (ii) that the inclusion of diabetes severity weakens the coefficient of self-reported.  To investigate }\DIFaddend this, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{first estimate models additionally controlling for self-reported health status to capture }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{replace the indicator variable for diabetes with a variable that takes the value zero for levels below and the actual value of }\ac{HbA1c} \DIFadd{for those above the diabetes threshold. The results in Table \ref{tab:Diagnosed_undiagnosed_robust}, panel A do not find a consistent relationship between increased }\ac{HbA1c} \DIFadd{levels and the probability of employment, suggesting that disease severity may not explain the different employment effects of diabetes. 
}

\DIFadd{Secondly, to assess whether the differences in effect are driven by }\DIFaddend differences in subjective \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{individual health. Secondly, we investigate in how far differences in measured }%DIFDELCMD < \ac{HbA1c}%%%
\DIFdel{, as a proxy for diabetes severity, may explain differences in employment effects }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{health, we include additional controls for self-reported health. The results are reported in Table \ref{tab:Diagnosed_undiagnosed_robust}, panel B, and indicate that the relationship between employment and self-reported diabetes becomes weaker, resulting in reduced difference between self-reported and undiagnosed diabetes. For women, the point estimates for self-reported diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes are now virtually of the same size, suggesting that differences in general health drive the above results, though the difference was not very big to begin with. For men, it appears differences in health between the two groups play a role, however, other unobserved factors are still important.
}

\DIFadd{Thirdly, instead of controlling for subjective health we include a battery of indicators for other chronic diseases that are often related to diabetes. In detail, we control for overweight and obesity (based on anthropometrically measured }\ac{BMI}\DIFadd{) and self-reports of a diagnosis of hypertension and heart disease. If those diagnosed with diabetes are more likely to experience adverse employment outcomes because they are more likely to suffer from one of these diseases, then accounting for them should lead to a sizeable reduction in the coefficient }\DIFaddend of self-reported \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and undiagnosed diabetes. To this end we estimate Eq. \ref{eq:diab_ud} additionally controlling for }%DIFDELCMD < \ac{HbA1c} %%%
\DIFdel{levels.}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{diabetes. In line with the results in panel B, we find a reduction in the coefficient for self-reported diabetes in both men and women, though the reduction here is much bigger for men than for women. Having had a diagnosis of heart disease is significantly associated with lower employment probabilities for men, and overall the coefficient for self-reported diabetes in men is reduced by about one percentage point after the inclusion of these diabetes related diseases.}\footnote{\DIFadd{Further analysis indicates that the reductions in the diabetes coefficient for men appear after the inclusion of heart disease as well as hypertension, while ovwerweight and obesity play a minor role.}}

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \label{sec:cha_4_conclusion}\DIFaddend Conclusion}

Diabetes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{has become }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is now }\DIFaddend one of the most common chronic diseases in middle- and high-income countries, with the potential to severely impact the health and economic well-being of those \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{directly (and possibly indirectly) }\DIFdelend affected. Yet \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{there remains only limited 'hard' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{rigorous }\DIFaddend evidence on the economic consequences \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, especially }\DIFdelend for these countries \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. Moreover, what evidence does exist at best partially tackles the econometric challenges involved}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{remains scarce}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This paper improves on existing work by addressing several methodological challenges that arise due to the nature of the disease and types of data available, using }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{To address key methodological challenges this paper uses }\DIFaddend rich longitudinal panel data from Mexico \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, a }%DIFDELCMD < \ac{MIC} %%%
\DIFdel{for which the biomarker dataused in this paper indicates that diabetes, including undiagnosed diabetes, has reached alarming levels. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that also contain biomarker data. The biomarker data confirm the alarming levels of clinically tested diabetes, 27}\%\DIFadd{, and indicate that a large proportion of these (68}\% \DIFadd{of those with diabetes or 18}\% \DIFadd{of the population) are unaware that they have the condition. 
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Apart from providing unique evidence for a developing country, the paper makes methodological contributions for the estimation of labor market effects of diabetes. By estimating individual fixed effects the analysis provides an improved accounting for the endogeneity of self-reported diabetes, as this allows canceling out the potential role of unobserved individual traits that may affect both labor market outcomes and propensity to self-report (or suffer from) diabetes . Using further information on the year of diagnosis enables us to investigate the potential heterogeneity in the effect }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The paper finds evidence for adverse effects }\DIFaddend of self-reported diabetes on \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{labor market outcomes over time. Finally, taking advantage of biomarker data to identify the entire diabetes population, i.e. including those with undiagnosed diabetes, allows for an assessment of }\DIFdelend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{potential bias in estimates relying on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{probability of being employed, but not on wages or hours worked, using fixed effects estimation.  Considering different types of work, the relationship between }\DIFaddend self-reported diabetes\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(which is still the most frequent measure in the previous literature).
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, and wages and hours worked remains weak, but the results also suggest occupational selection with women with self-reported diabetes less likely to work in agriculture.  A dynamic analysis finds that the employment probability falls gradually over the years after having been diagnosed with this chronic condition.  
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The first part of our results confirms a considerable gap in employment probabilities for both men and women reporting a diabetes diagnosis, compared to those that do not report the condition. We also find some evidence that diabetes is more likely to reduce the probability }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Making use of the biomarker data allows us to both test reporting error and the effects }\DIFaddend of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{employment in the agricultural and self-employment sector, characterized predominantly by informal arrangements, compared to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{undiagnosed diabetes. The results confirm }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{rest of the workforce. Those who remain employed do not suffer any wage or labor supply effects , possibly because they are still relatively healthy or are able to resort to a type of work that does not entail their diabetesstatus limiting their work-related performance. More research will be needed to confirm and further investigate this finding as well as its interpretation.

\DIFdel{Regarding the heterogeneity in the effects of diabetes over time, our results indicate an adverse }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{large proportion that is unaware of the condition.  We contrast }\DIFaddend impact of self-reported \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and tested diabetes, and find that it is similar for women but not for men.  Combined results suggest lower employment for the diagnosed, especially for men, while there is no employment effect for undiagnosed men or women.  This lack of employment effect for undiagnosed men seems to stem from better general health rather than less severe diabetes. The results highlight both the importance of the economic impact of }\DIFaddend diabetes\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on employment chances, with the impact growing in magnitude especially after the first 10 years post-diagnosis. This is plausible in that as time lived with diabetes evolves, complications associated with diabetes tend to become more frequent and more severe }%DIFDELCMD < \parencite{Adler2003}%%%
\DIFdel{.  Looking at wages as our labor market outcome, we uncover some adverse effects for females, indicating a sizable reduction with time since diagnosis.  These findings may bode ill for countries were diabetes has started appearing at an increasingly younger age, causing people to live with the disease for larger parts of their productive lifespan, possibly exacerbating the economic effects of reduced employment due to diabetes}%DIFDELCMD < \parencite{Hu2011,Villalpando2010}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, and the need to take into account (especially female) undiagnosed patients, especially for women}\DIFaddend . 

The second part of our results indicates that only relying on self-reported diabetes can lead to an overestimation of the relationship between diabetes and labor \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{market }\DIFdelend outcomes. We find that a negative relationship only exists for those with self-reported, but not for those with undiagnosed diabetes. This perhaps surprising, notable difference, is at least mediated by the subjective health status being worse for those self-reporting compared to the undiagnosed. Current disease severity, as proxied by \ac{HbA1c} levels, does not appear to play an important role in this context.

Our findings bear several implications. First, when interpreting labor market impact estimates relying on self-reported diabetes, one cannot assume that the results extend to those with undiagnosed diabetes. However, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the strategy of }\DIFdelend simply merging self-reported and undiagnosed in one diabetes category may not be ideal \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{either}\DIFaddend , as doing so will fail to account for the heterogeneity between the groups in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the amount }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{terms }\DIFaddend of health information\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{they possess, the time they have already been exposed to elevated blood glucose levels }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, their actual time of living with diabetes }\DIFaddend and consequently their subjective as well as true health status, leading to a potentially important loss of information. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{If, by contrast, both groups are separately accounted for in the model, thereby }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{By contrast, accounting for both groups separately }\DIFaddend acknowledging their inherent differences, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{this allows us }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{allows }\DIFaddend to gain information about the distribution of the economic burden across the two groups.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Further, the results of the biomarker analysis also reveal that the coefficient of self-reported diabetes is not strongly affected when accounting for biomarker diagnosed diabetes, suggesting that using self-reported diabetes  still provides largely unbiased estimates. The latter estimates should then of course only be used to draw conclusions about the effect of self-reported diabetes, not of diabetes overall. In the case of Mexico, given that more than 7}%DIFDELCMD < \% %%%
\DIFdel{of the Mexican population have been diagnosed with diabetes, the identified reduction in employment probabilities still amounts to a significant overall economic burden being associated with (diagnosed) diabetes.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend Our results add further weight to the case for reducing the incidence and progression of diabetes. On top of the well-documented health benefits, it appears there are considerable \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{potential }\DIFdelend gains to be had \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in terms of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{by }\DIFaddend increasing the productive lifespan of people. This is of particular importance in \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \ac{LMICs}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \acl{LMICs}\DIFaddend , where parental health shocks, related job loss and increasing health expenditures can have repercussions across the entire household. Other family members, including children, may be forced to increase their labor supply and to reduce non-health expenditures in order to prevent \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a }\DIFaddend deterioration of the household's economic situation. This can lead to forgone investments into child education, showcasing the potential for adverse long-term effects of health shocks due to diabetes \parencite{Bratti2014}. Moreover, the large proportion of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{undiagnosed people indicates that diagnosis ---at least in Mexico--- }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{previously undiagnosed cases indicates that diagnosis---at least in Mexico---still }\DIFaddend happens too late or not at all\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, thereby significantly reducing the possibility }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. This reduces the possibilities }\DIFaddend to prevent complications via \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{appropriate }\DIFdelend treatment and self-management, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{which has repercussions by }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{consequently }\DIFaddend increasing the risk of severe complications appearing \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{early}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{earlier}\DIFaddend . Hence, much of the health and economic burden may be prevented by earlier diagnosis and, given the generally limited success in achieving good \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{blood-glucose }\DIFaddend control in Mexico, better treatment of those already diagnosed with diabetes. Ultimately of course, there will be a need to invest in the prevention of diabetes\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cases in the first place}\DIFdelend . Taxation of sugar sweetened beverages may be one promising way forward \parencite{Colchero2016}, though the long-term effects \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in terms of diabetesprevention remain to be demonstrated}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{remain to be demonstrated. Further, considering the double-disease burden of non-communicable and communicable diseases and malnutrition in many }\acl{LMICs}\DIFadd{, investments in maternal and child health may not only reduce the current disease burden but would likely reduce the future incidence of diabetes, given the established links between early life heath status and later life incidence of diabetes and other chronic diseases }\parencite{Sotomayor2013,Hanson2012,Li2010b}\DIFadd{.  
}

\DIFadd{Our results indicate a significant economic burden of diabetes and it is unlikely that it will be reduced in the near future given that diabetes has started appearing at an increasingly younger age in many }\ac{LMICs}\DIFadd{, causing people to live with the disease for larger parts of their productive lifespan, possibly exacerbating the economic effects of reduced employment due to diabetes }\parencite{Hu2011,Villalpando2010}\DIFadd{. Therefore, population level measures as well as efforts to improve early-life health are needed to prevent a further increase in diabetes, as is a better integration of diabetes care in the existing health system will be needed to reduce its burden now and in the future}\DIFaddend .

\section{\label{sec:Appendix}Strategies to deal with inconsistent self-reporting over time}

Reporting error \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is likely to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{can }\DIFaddend pose a considerable challenge in the use of self-reported data. Fortunately, the \ac{MxFLS} data provides several possibilities to assess the amount of misreporting and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to attempt to limit }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{apply corrections }\DIFaddend before estimating the labor market effects of diabetes. In what follows we describe \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{our approach of dealing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{how we deal }\DIFaddend with inconsistencies in self-reported diabetes over time.


\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Throughout the surveys, self-reported diabetes was measured by the question 'Have you ever been diagnosed by diabetes'. If they answered 'yes', they were asked if they received treatment for diabetes and the type of treatment they received.
}

\DIFaddend One of the key advantages of panel data is the repeated measurement \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{giving }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{which results in }\DIFaddend more than one data point\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for many of the individuals, thereby allowing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, which allows }\DIFaddend to uncover inconsistencies for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{those with at least two observations. While we are not aware of any literature investigating the issue of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cases with multiple observations. Very little is known about }\DIFaddend inconsistencies in self-reported diabetes over time\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, a study by \textcite{Zajacova2010} , on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. However, \textcite{Zajacova2010} assess }\DIFaddend the consistency of a self-reported cancer diagnosis over time in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a USApopulation, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the USA. The study }\DIFaddend found that 30\% of those who had reported a cancer diagnosis at an earlier point \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{did report }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{failed to report the diagnosis }\DIFaddend at a later point \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that they never had received a cancer diagnosis. They also found that a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in time. A }\DIFaddend more recent diagnosis was \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{found to be }\DIFaddend reported with greater consistency possibly due to increasing recall problems \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and/or reduced salience }\DIFdelend as time since diagnosis \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{progresses}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{passes}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Assessing the data we use, we }\DIFaddend also find inconsistencies in the diabetes self-reports \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{over }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{across }\DIFaddend the three waves\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of the }%DIFDELCMD < \ac{MxFLS} %%%
\DIFdel{data}\DIFdelend , with between 10--20\% of those reporting diabetes in one wave not doing so in one of the subsequent waves. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In order to reduce the amount of inconsistencies, we were interested in the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{To improve the }\DIFaddend validity of diabetes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{self-reports.
While we could not find a study assessing the validity of self-reported diabetesin Mexico, a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{self-reports, we are interested in reducing the amount of reporting inconsistencies.
}

\DIFadd{As discussed at the end of section \ref{sec:Data}, for diabetes for diabetes, the main concern with mismeasurement is related to false negatives.

Our data shows a similar pattern, with a negligible proportion (3}\DIFaddend \%\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{or did report taking diabetesmedication, indicating relatively high specificity in our data as well}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{) of the respondents who are tested negative self-reporting to suffer from diabetes, while the majority of those who are tested positive (68}\%\DIFadd{) do not self-report suffering from diabetes}\DIFaddend .

We used \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{this }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the above }\DIFaddend information to infer the "true" diabetes status for those with inconsistent reports. For \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{those with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{respondents present in all three waves, we corrected inconsistencies as reported in Table \ref{tab:Inconsistencies}. We assumed that if diabetes was reported only once in the first two waves (either in 2002 or 2005) and then not reported again in the ensuing waves, this diabetes report was likely to be false (see lines 3 and 4 in Table \ref{tab:Inconsistencies}) and that the person never had received a diagnosis. If a diabetes diagnosis was however reported in two of the three waves (in 2002 and 2009 but not 2005, or in 2002 and 2005 but not in 2009) we assumed that the respondent had diabetes in all three waves (see lines 1 and 2 in Table \ref{tab:Inconsistencies}). For those cases where we only had information from }\DIFaddend two waves, we assumed that if a diabetes diagnosis had been reported in a prior wave they also had diabetes in the ensuing wave, even if \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{then }\DIFdelend it was not reported \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.
For people where we had data from all three waves, we used that additional information to make a decision on how to deal with inconsistencies using the rules outlined in Table \ref{tab:Inconsistencies}
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in the latter (see lines 5 and 6 in Table \ref{tab:Inconsistencies}). This relies on the assumption that diabetes does not go away: once one has had diabetes, it can be managed to keep blood sugar levels outside the diabetes range, but the condition cannot be abolished.
